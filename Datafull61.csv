This is the process of offering a gift for a birthday,Irrelevant
The process start when I decide if I will buy the gift in one of the online applications or in a store,Relevant
If I m busy  I use the online applications  if I m not  I buy in a store,Relevant
If I decide to buy the gift online  I take a look in all online sites to find the gift corresponding to my budget and the offers,Relevant
If i choose what I m going to buy  the application check if I have already entered my data  if not  the application demands my data,Relevant
Then  I enter my credit card data and execute the payment  if I have enough money to execute the operation  then it will be executed  if not  the application will cancel my demand,Relevant
Aftrewards  if the operation went well  I choose if I sign on the arrival of purchased item or not,Relevant
Then the application gives me an estimated waiting time to receive the item,Relevant
Finally  when the time of reception of the item arrives  the deliverer comes to the address indicated in the application to give me the article,Relevant
I sign in his phone or in a paper that I received my order,Relevant
If I decide to buy the gift in a store  I go to see several stores,Relevant
When I choose what i m going to buy,Relevant
Then I choose if I m going to pay by cash or by credit card,Relevant
If I pay by cash  I give the salesperson the price of the item,Relevant
If not I pay by credit card  I enter the card code  and I take the gift,Relevant
In the end  I give my friend the gift,Relevant
This process is about looking for an internship,Irrelevant
I determine the sector in which I will be staging,Relevant
Then I establish a CV according to the sector I have chosen,Relevant
To apply for companies  I can either apply online or submit the CV to the company in person,Irrelevant
If I choose to apply online  I must post the CV on the site or send it by email to the targeted company,Relevant
If not  I drop it off in person,Relevant
In both cases  the company asks me to do a pre internship interview if they like my CV  if not  they have to inform me by phone or by email that my CV is not congruent to their criteria,Relevant
If I pass the interview  I start my internship directly  if not I will have to see another company,Relevant
 A customer needs new kid toys for his kid,Irrelevant
 The process starts when the customer clicks on order button and places his order  ,Relevant
 My store receives the order and informs me by a notification  ,Relevant
 I check the availability of the product from my supplier  ,Relevant
 If it is out of stock  the customer will get informed by a message and he reject his order manually or get his money back automatically  ,Relevant
 If the product still exists in the stock  I confirm his order  ,Relevant
 I ship his items attached with Invoice  ,Relevant
 After a given days  the customer receives his order ,Relevant
 New customer enters our agency,Relevant
 We check if he already exists in our database,Relevant
 If he exists  we propose him our services ,Relevant
 If he does not exist  we create a new account and then propose our services,Relevant
 If he reject our proposal  the process ends,Relevant
 If he accepts our services  we register his demand,Relevant
 We give him an appointment,Relevant
 After one week he still can refuse the demand or confirm,Irrelevant
Then  he receives the command,Relevant
The process is finished,Relevant
The process begins when someone is declaring a damage for which he wants to be compensated,Relevant
For that  he has several ways to state the incident,Irrelevant
The choice will impact the way the clerk will address the issue,Irrelevant
The claim management officer will firstly check if the person declaring is an actual client of Ethias,Relevant
For the application or the website channel  this check will be done by the person itself,Relevant
Obviously  the victim must be a client of Ethias in order to be compensated  if not  the process ends here by informing the victim the steps that he should follow in order to be eligible for the coverage,Relevant
In some cases  when the incident is claimed by phone  the clerk starts by asking the victim if he or she needs some support such as a tow truck for instance,Relevant
Then the victim will share key information with the officer of the claims management department to make the declaration,Relevant
Whether it is by phone or by mail  the information is transcribed into the IT system,Relevant
If the declaration is done via the form in the application or website of Ethias  the information ends up directly in the IT system,Relevant
After that  the case is opened for the client and the process may continue with the case instruction and examination to see if it meets the conditions to compensate the victim,Relevant
To this end  the clerk will assess if there is a matter of liability in the case or not  as well as checking if the client contract covers the damage that occurred and assessing the level of damage by means of experts or by his experience,Relevant
At the same time  the case handler decides which type of reservation the case should follow,Relevant
In the perspective of an actuarial reservation  he informs the actuarial department by sending the case to it,Relevant
In the other perspective  the clerk defines the amount to reserve by himself and sends it to the actuarial department to be approved,Relevant
The case handler sees if the coverage conditions are fulfilled  that is to say that for cases of engaged liabilities the client should be considered liable  otherwise it s not up to his insurance to compensate,Relevant
The other condition is that the contract should cover the damage,Relevant
In the end  a notification with the outcome will be sent to the client and if these conditions are well fulfilled  Ethias will compensate for the damage,Relevant
The case is finally settled or unsettled,Relevant
In order to understand the reservation process better  it is necessary to clarify its purpose in the context of an insurance company  reservation allows Ethias to deal with future compensation needs by means of statistical computation techniques   for example  someone broke his leg this year and because of that  he might have complications like a need for a surgery years later,Relevant
Then  his insurance will have to compensate him once again,Relevant
That s why  on the insurance side  they have to make a reservation in order to be prepared for these cases,Irrelevant
As seen in the claims management process  the clerk decides which type of reservation is needed based on his evaluation,Relevant
Actuarial reservation only deals with cases considered as recurrent and with a higher level of generality  also  they are most of the time short term cases,Irrelevant
Otherwise  the clerk determines and evaluates by himself the amount to reserve but still sends it to the actuarial department for approbation,Relevant
So for this process  when the claim management officer informs the actuary that the case needs an actuarial reservation  the latter collects all the data regarding the case by means of a database,Relevant
Then he analyzes it in order to fix new hypotheses which will be used for computation,Relevant
This computation is handled by a mathematical program,Relevant
Nevertheless  to find which model to use  the actuary follows precise guidelines and rules,Irrelevant
The outcome of this computation will be checked by the actuarial control 4,Relevant
If changes are needed  the actuary will adjust his model and repeat the computation,Relevant
After the approbation by the actuarial control  the assessment of the case is sent to the accounting department in order to be accounted for,Relevant
It s up to the actuary to communicate the reservation to the accounting department,Relevant
To initiate this process  a product manager from the marketing or sales department requests to price a product,Relevant
Then the actuary team of the tarification department will gather data and statistics about the type of incidence that the service covers,Relevant
The Ethias database is filled with information in order to develop a technical model of tarification to take into account the specific risks and give a first price for the premium,Relevant
But this price does not always comply with the market demand and customer needs  this is the reason why the actuary team and the product manager exchange information to compute a model more suitable for the market,Relevant
This second version of the model will be sent to the actuarial control in order to be reviewed and to check the perspective of profitability with the business plan,Relevant
When the review is done  if changes are needed the actuary team takes care of remodelling it and shows the model to the actuarial control once again until it s validated by it,Relevant
This validation must be followed by the agreement of all the stakeholders that are linked with this pricing process,Relevant
Their agreement is necessary before establishing the tariff and sending it to the product manager,Irrelevant
The underwriting process begins when a demand for insurance coverage is perceived by the sales department,Relevant
This demand is sent either by a peer to peer procedure between Ethias and the organisation  by a broker as an intermediate of the concerned company or by a tendering procedure on public markets,Relevant
This distinction doesn t change the process in essence  but rather in the outcomes and the channel of communication,Irrelevant
Then the demand is transferred into the CRM system of Ethias either by the sales officer or  in some cases  automatically,Relevant
Next  the sales officer checks if this demand comply with the business guidelines of Ethias in strategic or relationship terms,Relevant
Generally  the case complies and continues its path towards the underwriting department to follow two successive analysis procedures  first  an acceptance analysis which is made in order to make the decision to keep such demand or to reject it,Relevant
If the underwriter doesn t accept it then the process ends  otherwise he proceeds  in a second time  to a tarification analysis,Relevant
These two phases are modelled as subprocesses which consist of multiple tasks that should be done before setting the tariff and the offer,Relevant
In addition  a competence scheme helps to decide whether the offer needs to be agreed by two other third parties  BOL and HAC  or not  depending on the offer,Irrelevant
They can eventually ask for adjustment before pursuing the process,Relevant
Later on  if the third parties agreed when needed  the underwriter decides the channel through which he will make the offer,Relevant
Considering the circumstances  he has 3 possibilities  the offer could either be led directly towards the client through the CRM system  be led to an account manager  ACMA  that will defend the offer in front of the call for tenders or be placed in a share application for the sales department that will handle it from there,Relevant
The outcome of the offer will be communicated through the same channel used to make the offer,Relevant
The last tasks for the underwriter are to settle all the paperwork and then  depending on the outcome  to classify the case or not  if the outcome is negative  he must do so  if it is positive  the onus is not on him to do that and the process is over,Relevant
This process begins when a client requests insurance coverage,Relevant
He has the choice to fill in the subscription form digitally or to have contact with a clerk in an agency or via phone call,Relevant
The sales officer of the front office will define what services the customer needs and check if he is already a client in Ethias,Relevant
If it s not the case  the clerk affiliates him by asking for personal information,Relevant
Then the officer will check the client s incident data in DataSure  which is a database to centralise all the declared incidences from any insurance company  in order to decide if he is eligible for the services needed,Relevant
If he is not eligible  the rejection is communicated directly after this verification,Relevant
Either way  the clerk makes the first quotation with the information gathered and hands in to the client or sends it via letter or email if the request is made via phone call,Relevant
The client reviews it  fills it with extra information needed to establish any contracts and sends it back via the channel of his choice,Relevant
If it is physically  then the clerk decides if it meets the criteria of acceptance by analysing the risk,Relevant
The rejection is also communicated to the client after this verification,Relevant
If accepted  the clerk makes changes if needed by taking into account the review of the client and the extra information,Relevant
Then the contract is printed and given to the client and waited to be signed,Relevant
If it is digitally  the back office takes care of making the verification with the criteria and establishing the contract by taking into account all the data,Relevant
All this procedure is simplified if the client firstly decides to fill the subscription digitally,Relevant
For that he needs to be affiliated and this is made possible thanks to the website or the application,Irrelevant
The subscription form and client s data are sent directly to the back office to be evaluated and analysed,Relevant
The officer checks with the criteria of acceptance and decides whether to send a rejection or to establish and send the contract to be signed by the client,Relevant
The process starts when an employee is sick or absent for whatever reason,Relevant
The first step of the process has to be done by the employee  he has to send his medical certificate to the human resources and at the  same time   he has to contact them in order to inform them of the duration of its absence,Relevant
Thanks to this  the human resources can start their own process in which they try to replace him by someone,Relevant
Then  after both of these tasks have been completed  the next tasks will mainly concern the human resources department,Relevant
They have to sort out the different types of medical certificates  check if they are certificates without pathologies or certificates with pathologies,Relevant
On the one hand  if and only if the certificate is without any pathology  the human resources employee has to check it and verify if the certificate is valid,Relevant
Then  he has to verify some little things like the start of the absence  the end of it  and then he has to send a mail to SPCM to prevent them,Relevant
Following this  at the same time  he has to encode this absence in the system in order that all the organization can be aware of the absence of the employee and he has to notify the medical advisor too  and then the medical advisor will have to choose whether the veracity of this absence must be checked or not,Relevant
On the other hand  if and only if this certificate contains pathologies  the human resources employee has to send it directly to the  Service Provincial de contrôle médical  and has to fulfill a form,Relevant
After that  the SPCM checks if the certificate is correct and if there is any problem,Relevant
After that  he then gives his accord to the organization to encode this,Relevant
So  the human resources employee can encode this in the database,Relevant
Afterwards  at the same time  they have to notify the medical advisor  and then the medical advisor chooses to check the veracity of this absence or not  and  the human resources employee can check the date  the absence  etc,Relevant
After that  in addition they receive the acknowledgement of receipt and finally they can put the certificate in the HR certificate folder and the process is over,Relevant
The process starts at the end of the month when it is time to pay the different employees in the company,Relevant
We should note that almost the entire process is carried out by human resources,Irrelevant
Firstly  at the same time  the human resources employee is doing 4 different tasks  which are  check for extra hours  check leaving request  check attendance system in order to know how many hours the employee worked and then check it with the system  Unitime,Relevant
  Finally  he checks sickness  so if an employee was absent and then uses HR Accent in order to verify this,Relevant
When all these 4 steps are finally done  he writes a recap  with all the information so he can export them to Securex,Relevant
Securex checks the feedback and sends it to the human resources,Relevant
After receiving the feedback from Securex  the human resources employee treats the document in order to make a proposal for the salary,Relevant
After receiving the proposition  there is a question within the HR   are we agree with this proposition?  If no  the process restarted at the proposition of wage slip,Relevant
If the response is yes  we can continue the process,Relevant
Human resources can then send the payment permission to Securex and wait until the reception of Securex agreement,Relevant
Subsequently  several things have to be done at the same time  we are going to describe them branch by branch,Irrelevant
Firstly  in the first branch he receives the  décompte de paye  and then prints it in order to send the file to the employee,Relevant
Afterwards  there is a question   Is there any contestation?  If there is no contestation  we can continue and finalize the process with the acceptation of Securex payment,Relevant
But  if there is a contestation  we have to ask the CEO what to do with it and then a new process starts,Relevant
Finally  on the other branch  things that need to be done first are to ask Securex to prepare the invoice  then we are waiting until Securex creates it  and sends it,Relevant
After this  there is another question   Are we sending this to accounting or not?  If the answer is  yes   we can accept Securex s payment and the process ends,Relevant
And if no  once again we have to ask the CEO what to do,Relevant
This process starts when an application is sent by a candidate to the HR which do a first sorting and then a second one,Relevant
After this  the first interview take place,Relevant
Then we are in the first question which is  Is this a key position or not?  If yes  we need to know if we need complementary assessments    if yes  a specialist office makes a couple of tests and then sends the results to the HR,Relevant
After this  we conclude whether it is okay or not,Relevant
If it is not  we can dismiss the application and inform the applicant of that,Relevant
We therefore destroy these data,Relevant
But if it is okay  we arrive to the second interview which is important,Relevant
  If it is not necessary to get more assessments  we can go directly to the second interview,Relevant
So  at this moment  we are at the same point,Irrelevant
After the interview  there is a selection  if the candidate is not selected  then we can dismiss the application and inform the applicant of that  and destroy its data,Relevant
But if the candidate is selected  then HR sends a notification to the applicant and welcomes him as a new worker,Relevant
If it is not a key post  we are directly in the step of selection,Relevant
So  if the candidate is not selected  then we can dismiss the application and inform the applicant of that  and destroy its data,Relevant
But if the candidate is selected  then HR sends a notification to the applicant and welcomes him as a new worker,Relevant
The process starts when the financial department picks up an invoice in order to pay it,Relevant
It should be noted that the file in question is recuperated in the ISABEL system,Relevant
Firstly  the financial department employee prints the details of payment,Relevant
After this  he shows the file to the financial director,Relevant
Afterwards  he needs to classify the invoices according to whether they are above 150 000 euros or under 150 000 euros,Relevant
  When we are under 150 000  the financial employee just has to inform the HR department,Relevant
  When we are above 150 000  he has to ask the financial director to find out if it is okay,Relevant
After these steps  we follow the same path in both cases  and the process stays located in the financial and accounting department,Relevant
Then  the employee verifies the liquidity on the account in order to know if there are no problems with the treasury,Relevant
After that  he can send money to the bank account  send an email to CBC bank with the details of payment and finally register the payment in the SAP system  before ending with the receiving of the account statement,Relevant
This process starts when a client asks for an intervention,Relevant
This request is directly registered in a file,Relevant
Then  it must be checked if the intervention is included in the contract,Relevant
  If it is not  the client must be asked whether he agrees with the financial part and then the client must respond to this in order for the organization to get his feedback  If he doesn t agree  the process stops,Relevant
But if he agrees  the organization can define the costs of the intervention,Relevant
  If yes  the organization can define the costs,Relevant
After this  at that moment we are on the same track  it should be chosen if we need an internal quote or an external one,Relevant
We then arrive to 2 different questions  The first one is   Do we need an accord regarding the quote?      If the answer is  yes   the approbation of the client has to be asked,Relevant
If his answer is that it is okay  he must be informed about the start of the intervention,Relevant
Then the intervention is finished,Relevant
But if he refuses the quote  the process ends again,Relevant
  If the answer is  no   the client must be informed about the start of the intervention and also when it will be finished,Relevant
The process starts when a customer makes a request to open close the P1 S1 port  these are ports on the smart meter that allow the customer to connect their application on which they can consult their energy consumption in real time ,Relevant
The call is received by an interlocutor  called Connexio  working for a defined network distribution manager  in our case for ORES obviously ,Relevant
The Connexio will then control whether the customer is addressing the correct DNM using an identification database,Relevant
If it is the wrong DNM  the Connexio informs the customer and the call ends,Relevant
Once the DNM check has been carried out  he will proceed to a process check,Relevant
If it is a High Voltage process  the customer is redirected to another service  otherwise if the process is Low Voltage  the Connexio identifies the requester thanks to the database of municipalities and social housing then controls the verbal offer,Relevant
If it is not a verbal offer  the request is transferred to the  Connection Work  process,Relevant
If it is a verbal offer  the process continues and the Connexio controls the file,Relevant
If the file is existing  he informs the client and the process ends  otherwise  he communicates the price of the service to the customer and reads the GDPR disclaimer in case of an opening  then waits for the client s response,Relevant
If the client accepts  a file is created,Relevant
Otherwise the file is immediately closed and the process ends,Relevant
After having created the file  the Connexio asks if the client is able to receive a remote operation  if he is not able  he asks whether the preparatory work is the client s responsibility,Relevant
If he is able  is the client s request unique? If the client s request is not unique  he asks if the preparatory work is the client s responsibility  otherwise he asks directly what type of appointment to make,Relevant
Concerning the preparatory work  if they are not the client s responsibility  then the Connexio asks what type of appointment to make,Relevant
But if they are the responsibility of the customer  the Connexio informs the customer about the preparatory work  he waits for a response  if the customer does not accept  the file is closed and the process ends,Relevant
If he accepts then he also asks what type of appointment to make,Relevant
There are two types of appointments  The first one is if remote operations work  from June 2020   the Connexio sends confirmation to the customer but also to the control room that the thing has been taken into account,Relevant
The control room receives this remote operation request for opening   closing port P1   S1 and the process is terminated,Relevant
The second one is if the technician has to come to the customer s house  the Connexio controls the duration of the intervention  he schedules an appointment  if the intervention cannot be scheduled  the Connexio records the non schedulable intervention request and the call ends ,Relevant
After scheduling the appointment  he sends the appointment confirmation to the client  waits for the appointment confirmation,Relevant
After receipt  he sends the work order to the technician,Relevant
The technician receives the file and the process ends,Relevant
The process is separated in 2 lanes  fieldworker and Work control OSP,Irrelevant
The process starts with the reception of a request to install a smart meter for the activation of prepayment mode,Relevant
All the processes arrive at the same gateway so I will describe each process up to the point of intersection and then explain what happens after,Relevant
1  The customer was present and another customer was present,Relevant
If the customer wants a recovery  they process it to a recovery form,Relevant
If the customer doesn t want a recovery then they see if it is their first visit  a  2  Another customer was not present and the customer accepts the installation,Relevant
 b They check the communication network coverage,Relevant
If the communication network coverage is adequate they check for fraud,Relevant
If there is a suspected fraud they send the information to the fraud department and they wait for the attention return from the fraud service which sends an end signal to fraud management,Relevant
 c  After that  whether there is fraud or not  if there is not a smart technical impossibility they replace the meter with a smart meter,Relevant
If there is a smart technical impossibility and an electromechanical technical impossibility they send the information of non execution of the installation for technical impossibility,Relevant
If there is not an electromechanical technical impossibility they put a budget meter and activate prepayment mode,Relevant
If the communication network coverage is not adequate and there is a possibility for deporting the antenna  they move the antenna to another area covered by the network and follow  c ,Relevant
If there is no possibility for deporting the antenna they check the electromechanical technical possibility  such as in c ,Relevant
Another customer was not present and the customer does not accept the installation,Relevant
If the client is electro sensitive then the process goes directly to the checking of the electromechanics technical impossibility  in the c ,Relevant
If the client is not electro sensitive and it is their  a  first visit the process goes directly to the point of intersection,Relevant
If it is not their  a  first visit but it is their second visit and the meter installation is possible before shutdown then the process continues to point  b ,Relevant
If the meter installation is not possible before shutdown and a meter cut is possible  2 things happen simultaneously,Relevant
The first is checking if the meter installation is possible  if yes it goes to  b  if not it goes to the point of intersection,Relevant
The second is to send the cutout start execution request to the meter and then wait for the message of the smart meter cut back,Relevant
If there is no cancellation request they perform the cut on the meter,Relevant
 d  After that an effective cutoff confirmation is filed which sends a message to the customer then they send the effective cutoff information which lead to the intersection point and  e  in the Work control OSP lane receiving information on the execution of cuts which send an end signal of management of cut returns,Relevant
 f  If there is a cancellation request the process goes to the intersection point,Relevant
If a meter cut is not possible  g  they check the possibility of a network cut,Relevant
If a network cut is possible they send the request to start the execution of the network cut then wait for the message to start network cut back,Relevant
If there is a cancellation request the process arrives at  f  and if not they execute the cut network then follow  d ,Relevant
If a network cut is not possible they send the non cut information which simultaneously lead the process to the intersection point and in  h  the work control OSP lane receive the information about non execution of cuts which send an end signal of post administration,Relevant
3  The customer was not present and it is the first visit,Relevant
If the meter is not accessible the process goes directly to the intersection point,Relevant
If the meter was accessible  they check the communication network coverage,Relevant
 i  If the communication network coverage is adequate they check for fraud,Relevant
If there is a suspected fraud they send the information to the fraud department and wait for the attention return from the fraud service which sends an end signal to fraud management,Relevant
 j  After that  whether there is fraud or not  if there is not a smart technical impossibility the meter is replaced with a smart meter and the process goes to the intersection,Relevant
If there is a smart technical impossibility and an electromechanical technical impossibility the information is sent of non execution of the installation for technical impossibility,Relevant
If there is not an electromechanical technical impossibility they put an electromechanics budget meter and activate prepayment mode,Relevant
If the communication network coverage is not adequate and there is a possibility for deporting the antenna  the antenna is moved to another area covered by the network and follow  j ,Relevant
If there is no possibility for deporting the antenna they check the electrical technical possibility  such as in j ,Relevant
4  The customer was not present and it is not the first visit,Relevant
If it is their second visit and a meter installation is possible before shutdown they follow  i ,Relevant
If it is not their second visit or it is their second visit but the meter installation is not possible before shutdown  they check if a network cut is possible,Relevant
If yes  they send a request to start execution of the network cut and wait for a message of network cut back,Relevant
If there is a cancellation request the process goes to the intersection point and if not  they cut the installation  file an effective cutoff notice which sends a message to the customer and send confirmation of effective shutdown which leads the process to the intersection point and in the work control OSP lane  following  e ,Relevant
If the network cut is not possible the information is sent of the non execution of the cut which lead the process to the intersection point and in the work control OSP lane  following  h ,Relevant
All of these lead to one gateway  after that they complete the worksheet,Relevant
If the client is present  they sign the worksheet and if they are not a calling card is left for the customer which sends a message to them,Relevant
Both of them lead to saving the worksheet and ending the process in the Work control OSP lane with post administration,Relevant
This process is divided into 5 lanes  planned works  technical solution officer  supervisor  manager and CTM coordinator,Irrelevant
The process starts at planned works when an appointment s planning is needed,Relevant
First thing is to know if it is a grid construction work or not,Relevant
If it is not a grid construction work  planned works assess if it is a civil engineering operation,Relevant
If it is a civil engineering operation  they find out if there is an authorization or an information request  a ,Relevant
If it is not a civil engineering operation  is it an individual planning?  b  If it is a grid construction work that is needed  the file is sent to the technical solution officer,Relevant
 1  Planned works wait for the period defined in the order then check if there is a request for authorization or information,Relevant
 a  If it is an information request  planned works show the levelling zone and encodings to Powalco and then check KLIM and CICC and the process goes on,Relevant
If it is an authorization request  they check if the authorization has been received,Relevant
If it has been received  the process goes on  if it hasn t  planned works contact the competent authorities again to receive the authorization  then the process goes on,Relevant
Planned works then figure out if there s a presence of KLIM CICC,Relevant
If there is  the file is sent to the CTM coordinator  2  and planned works wait for the CTM coordinator s feedback,Relevant
When the feedback is received  the process goes on,Relevant
 *  If there is not a presence of KLIM CICC  planned works find out if it is an individual planning,Relevant
 b  If it is an individual planning  the process goes on,Relevant
If it is not an individual planning  they form the batches  transmit a list to the contractor and inform the client and the process goes on,Relevant
 c   *  Planned works then contact the client to arrange an appointment  they make the client aware of the preparatory work and then plan the appointment with them,Relevant
They send a confirmation email to the client,Relevant
If the reply received is negative  planned works contact the client again,Relevant
 c  If the reply is positive  planned works assess if the work is planned on a contractor,Relevant
If it is  planned works prepare the file that will be sent to the contractor and send it to him,Relevant
Then the process is done and a signal is sent to the process  Execute the work ,Relevant
If it is not  the file is sent to a technician and planned works assess if it is a civil engineering operation,Relevant
If it is not a civil engineering operation  the process is done and a signal is sent to the process  Execute the work ,Relevant
If it is a civil engineering operation  planned works send the file to the contractor to carry out civil engineering,Relevant
The process is then done and a signal is sent to the process  Execute the work ,Relevant
 1  When the technical solution officer gets the file  they get back the file s investment cronos and check the CTM,Relevant
If there is a CTM file  it is sent to the CTM coordinator  2  and the process goes on,Relevant
If there is not a CTM file  the process goes on,Relevant
The technical solution officer adjusts the file   d  asks for authorization  inform planned works of the theoretical period  * ,Relevant
The officer finally transfers the file to the supervisor and his part is over,Relevant
When the supervisor gets the file  he checks if the authorization is received,Relevant
If it is not received  the process goes back to the officer,Relevant
 d  If it is received  the supervisor executes the construction work  foresees the end of the work and informs the manager  which gets the info  then sends the file to the manager and the process is done,Relevant
The manager gets the file  foresees the end of the work  executes the operation work  informs planned works of the end of the works  *  and then the operation work is done,Relevant
 2  The CTM coordinator gets the file  contacts the other recipients  visits the work site  creates a report and sends the feedback to planned works,Relevant
He then informs the technician and the contractor and the CTM is managed,Relevant
The two main ORES services involved in the work execution process are the  planned works  department and the executing agent working in parallel,Irrelevant
Three other ORES actors play a lighter role  namely the  design office    supervision  and  local logistics manager ,Irrelevant
Executing agent  The process starts with the receipt of the file,Relevant
Then either civil engineering works are required or not,Relevant
If they are required  the agent plans them  informs the  planned works  of the civil engineering opening date  1   then carries out the inventory of fixtures  executes the earthworks and finally confirms the execution of the earthworks to the  planned works   2 ,Relevant
Otherwise  nothing happens,Relevant
After that  the executing agent tries to reach the client 15 minutes before his departure and then goes to his home,Relevant
If the client can be reached and is present  he carries out the inventory of fixtures,Relevant
If the client is not present at first  the agent tries to reach him but if he is still unreachable  the executing agent then leaves a calling card  calls the BOPW  encodes the mobile data and finally signs the report,Relevant
The Process ends in the management of the nonexecuted,Relevant
After the inventory of fixtures  the agent checks whether additional work at the client s request is necessary  if not he can directly check the certificate of conformity,Relevant
If any work is required  the agent looks whether he needs BOPW information,Relevant
If so  he will request it and wait for confirmation,Relevant
In case of refusal  he checks the certificate of conformity,Relevant
In case of confirmation or if BOPW information is not required  he informs the customer of the costs  asks for his agreement  carries out the work and finally checks the certificate of conformity,Relevant
After checking the certificate of conformity  he checks the power and then jointly measures the column and replaces the meter and the parameter,Relevant
In the event of a problem at the time of replacement or parameter setting  the agent informs the local logistics manager  3   if the problem concerns only one meter the operation is repeated  otherwise an electromechanical meter is installed  then the customer is informed and the agent answers any questions in the same way as if the parameter setting was carried out correctly,Relevant
After that  if the LED confirms the functionality,Relevant
Then the meter is switched on  otherwise it is left switched off,Relevant
Then  he draws up an inspection plan which he sends to the Ores drawing office  4   enters the connection and counting data  confirms the materials used  draws up the output inventory and has the customer sign the report,Relevant
If civil works are required  the agent plans the closure of the civil works  informs the  planned works  of the closure date  5   plugs up the holes  repairs in a definitive manner  makes the inventory of fixtures and finally confirms the completion of the repair to the  planned works   6 ,Relevant
Finally  his last task is to encode the internal services in the case of internal services or to encode the internal services in the case of entrepreneurial work,Relevant
The process ends by sending the file to the post administration,Relevant
Planned work  The process begins with the planning of the worksite,Relevant
Then  if civil engineering works are required  the  planned works  department receives the civil engineering opening date from the executing agent  1   the department then sends the civil engineering dates to the client  waits and finally receives confirmation of the earthworks by the executing agent  2 ,Relevant
If no civil engineering works are required  the  planned works  department informs the client by sms of the date of the works 48 hours in advance,Relevant
The department then receives the execution information,Relevant
If the execution is not carried out  the process ends and the  prepare for execution  process begins,Relevant
If it has been carried out  there is a waiting period,Relevant
Finally  again if civil works are required  the  planned works  department receives the civil works closing date from the executing agent  5   the department then sends the civil works closing dates to the client  waits  receives the confirmation of the civil works closing from the executing agent  6  and finally updates the data in the POWALCO software,Relevant
If there is no civil engineering  nothing happens,Relevant
The process is then completed towards post administration,Relevant
The drawing office  The process starts with the reception of the plan from the executing agent  4  and is then completed towards post administration,Relevant
Monitoring The process starts with the reception of the date of the works  then the service ensures the supervision of the building sites and the process is finished with supervised building sites,Relevant
Local logistics manager  The process starts with the reception of the message from the executing agent  3   then he processes the request and the process ends,Relevant
The process starts at planned works when a technical visit is needed,Relevant
If a visit without appointment  V1  is needed  planned works transfer the request to a technician and waits for feedback with the info concerning the V1,Relevant
While planned work is waiting  a technician gets the request  carries out the visit and transfers info to planned works before being done with V1,Relevant
When planned works get the V1 info  they can move on and prepare a file for a technical visit  V2 ,Relevant
If a V1 is not needed  planned works directly prepare a file for a technical visit,Relevant
Planned works then plan V2 with the client,Relevant
After  they send a request to agents to know their availability,Relevant
When the agents get the request  they process it taking into account geographical and technical skills and send back their availabilities to planned works,Relevant
After receiving the agents  availability  planned works confirm the appointment with the client and send the file to a technician,Relevant
They then wait for feedback while the technician gets the request  carries out a technical visit and sends their feedback,Relevant
When the feedback is received  planned works handle it and then assess if civil engineering is required,Relevant
If it is not required the processing is done,Relevant
Otherwise  the feedback is sent to the contractor and the processing is done,Relevant
The subscription process is facilitated by the digital transformation  in usual context the customer and the company are engaged into an endless mail exchange demanding the documents for the subscription,Irrelevant
Thanks to Flora a new client only needs to enter some information about his property and his insurance fee is automatically calculated using the dimension and the location of his property,Relevant
If the new client is not in the defaulters  database  there is no need for an employee to take part in the process  the contract and insurance details will be automatically digitally created and sent to the customer,Relevant
If the client is indeed in the defaulter s database  Flora needs to conduct a short investigation to determine if they accept the client or not before finishing the process following the classical way,Relevant
By using this process  customers are now able to modify their contract online  following a move for instance  by simply entering details about their new property,Irrelevant
Their new price is calculated in the same way as in the subscription process  and the rest is also similar  contract and insurance details will be automatically created and sent to the customers as well as the new contract start date,Irrelevant
Flora allows the customer to make this report via a chatbox within the mobile app in a few steps,Irrelevant
Of course after the declaration  an external contractor will come to your place to contact the damage but there is no need to extra paperwork that is usually used with the traditional way,Relevant
The following process is of high interest as switching insurance can be really difficult and require documents and long procedures from both the former and the new insurance company,Irrelevant
Noting that  this is actually a sub process of the subscription as most new clients are often covered before subscribing to Flora,Irrelevant
To complete the process  customers are invited to enter different information about their former contract such as the company and their contract number,Relevant
Then the resignation form is generated and signed online by clients using Itsme  Belgian Mobile ID initiative ,Relevant
The rest of the process is handled by Flora  which will deal with the former insurer and will send them the resignation form,Relevant
Once these tasks are completed  details about the former contract terms end date and the new contract start date are sent to customers,Relevant
At last  the new contract will automatically start at the end of the former one,Relevant
By using Flora  a procedure that can take several days for clients is now completed in a few minutes,Irrelevant
Filling a complaint is one of the most common processes inside an insurance company,Irrelevant
This is usually a very tedious process for the client but now thanks to the new channel of communication  it is much easier for the clients using the Flora s application in order to fill a complaint  this can be done in few minutes,Irrelevant
The prospection and commercial process is triggered by the sales engineers who study the requirements of the prospects potential clients,Relevant
Then the CEO COO elaborate sales strategy and set individual goals,Relevant
Sales Engineers receive requests for quotation from clients and afterwards they consider whether the project submitted by the customers is feasible for Alpha or not,Relevant
If not  the request is declined and the process is stopped,Relevant
But if the quotation is feasible  sales engineers work together with the help of R D engineers to make a technical and commercial offer and ask for client s agreement,Relevant
If the customer s answer is not favorable  then they try to know on which point they failed to interest the customer  and then the process is stopped,Relevant
But conversely if the customer s response is favorable then back office registers new client and its order in the ERP system,Relevant
The sales engineers compare the order with the quotation made at the customer  price  quantity  product description  delay  and after that  a contract is written by the CEO in collaboration with the sales engineer  with the possibility of having some negotiations with the customers on commercial terms,Relevant
If the order is compliant with the offer made  the back office checks the availability of the product and the production delay announced by the ERP system,Relevant
Otherwise  the continuity of the process goes back to the steps before  there are once again negotiations with the customers in order to find a common agreement ,Relevant
When these two tasks are completed  the back office confirms and validates the order to the client  and they register the complete order in the ERP system,Relevant
Once this last step is completed  the prospection and commercial process ends,Relevant
The R D process starts when a need is expressed,Relevant
Sales engineers and R D engineers formalize the request  describe the new product and evaluate the feasibility  cost  strategy coherence   in the early stages,Relevant
Then the CEO COO challenge their analyze and decide if the feasibility is conceivable  the project is stopped if it is not the case ,Relevant
Sales engineers and R D engineers check prototype scale feasibility   conduct tests,Relevant
If the project is technically validated by R D  the production engineers go on by checking industrial feasibility and preparing production file,Relevant
After that step  the Quality Manager certificates the product and requests client s approval by sending them the previous documents,Relevant
If the customer s feedback is good  the bill of materials is made and the current process ends  otherwise the engineers continue to improve the development plans and the process is repeated in the stages of carrying out tests and analyzing feasibility on a prototype scale,Relevant
The process starts when the engineers make the BOM  Bill of Materials  and send the file with the logistical needs defined by a color code,Relevant
Consequently  a need is expressed and registered in the ERP system,Relevant
The supply chain department looks at the BOM and then decides if it needs comparative quotes,Relevant
  If the purchase amount is estimated to be greater than 10000  comparative quotes are needed,Relevant
In this case  the supply chain department searches suppliers  consults three of them and compare their offers,Relevant
Then  it chooses a supplier,Relevant
  If the purchase amount is estimated to be less than 10000  the supply chain department does not need comparative quotes and directly selects a supplier,Relevant
After selecting a supplier  there are two options    If this is a new supplier  the specific team  composed by the COO  the head of the supply chain department and the quality manager  performs a supplier audit,Relevant
If the conclusions of this audit are not positive  the supply chain department selects another supplier,Relevant
If the audit is conclusive  the supply chain manager registers supplier s information in the ERP system and sends a notification to the supplier selected,Relevant
  If Alpha Innovations has already worked with this supplier  the specific team sends a notification to the supplier selected,Relevant
Afterwards  the supply chain department establishes the order and receives the material once the supplier has fulfilled the order,Relevant
In some case  a conformity certificate is required  because AISA works with railway companies  RATP for example  or nuclear sector where high level of traceability is mandatory,Relevant
#NAME?
  In some cases  the supply chain organizes quality control for incoming and finished goods and the warehouse clerk checks it,Relevant
Alpha Innovations controls most of the time the products  quality  except when it comes to checking small parts  like basic screws  etc ,Relevant
If the quality control shows material is defective  the supply chain gives the order to the warehouse clerk to return the product to the supplier,Relevant
If the quality control is good  the warehouse clerk stores the product and registers it in the ERP system,Relevant
Finally  the head of supply chain  the quality manager and the COO evaluate the supplier s performance  ask for corrective actions if the supplier is not performant enough  and then the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when the workshop manager receives the project from the R D department,Relevant
With the recommendations from the production engineer  he evaluates which and how many workers must be assigned to this project linked to the difficulty s level of the latter,Relevant
With the help of the supply chain manager  he checks when all the needed material  BOM  will be available in stock at the factory,Relevant
With all this information  he gives an approximation of the delivery date to the customer,Relevant
He receives a set of documents thanks to the ERP system which describes  the BOM  Bill of Materials   mechanical plans  electrical scheme  control prescription    everything that is needed to organize production of the project,Relevant
The supply chain department receives the document and launches a production order to the warehouse clerk who prepares and sends all the materials needed to the workshop,Relevant
At this stage  the workshop manager must prepare assembly aid documents which describe the production process adapted to the type of work to be executed,Relevant
The function of the workshop manager is also to describe the jobs of each technician involved,Relevant
Afterwards  technicians operate  first  they prepare nameplates to be able to identify all the products and cables,Relevant
Secondly  they assembly the systems while they identify themselves at each step of the process for the tracing and consequently the responsibility,Relevant
The workshop manager is responsible for describing the complexity of conformity control which is afterwards operate by the technicians,Relevant
At this stage  test technicians operate the FAI  First Article Inspection   they inspect the finished systems  to see if it is safe  functional and conform to the specifications,Relevant
If all tests are conclusive  the system is sent to the shipment employee who will package and send it to customers with the help of other actors  haulers    ,Relevant
The systems production process ends at the moment the system is submitted to the shipment employee,Relevant
The process is triggered when the product is received by the packaging employee who packages the product,Relevant
Then  two tasks are done in parallel  addition of a suitable ID label to the package and wedging and wrapping to protect the product,Relevant
The packaging employee makes the delivery form and send it to the head of shipment department who is going to give a pick list number and  afterwards  registers the pick list number on the ERP system,Relevant
Later on  the packaging employee fills the picklist with the product s information  weight  date     on the ERP system,Relevant
Subsequently  the employee stores the product in the shipment area,Relevant
After that  the head of shipment management received on the ERP system the picklist completed and then classify the picklist by due date until the delivery day,Relevant
When the delivery day has come  the back office does two tasks at the same time  to prepare the delivery note and print it and prepare the invoice and print it as well,Relevant
After that  the back office sends the documents to all services concerned via the ERP system  i e  accounting ,Relevant
Finally  the packaging employee add the waybill and the delivery note on the package and thereafter he gives the package to the haulers,Relevant
The process ends when the order is sent,Relevant
The process starts when IT equipment is needed by a service manager,Relevant
The request is first analyzed by the head of the IT Department and they have to decide if the request is justified or not,Relevant
If the request is not justified  the process ends,Relevant
If the request is justified  they also have to decide if they accept it or not  in some cases  the request is justified but the solution requested to this need seems to be inappropriate ,Relevant
If the request is not accepted  but stays justified obviously   the service manager has the opportunity to adapt the request and suggests a new request  that the head of IT Department will analyze again and the process starts again,Relevant
The service manager has also the choice to not adapt his request and the process ends in this case,Relevant
But if the request is accepted  then the head of IT department asks for a quote,Relevant
If it is the first time that the supplier works with the company  the purchasing department has to add this supplier in the suppliers evaluation form,Relevant
If the budget or treasury will be affected with this expense  the Chief Financial Officer has to analyze the expense and decides if he validates the expense or not,Relevant
If he does not validate it  then the head of the IT Department has to ask for a new quote to a new supplier,Relevant
If the expense is validated  the head of the IT Department completes the purchase form and then the purchasing department makes the order and sends it to the supplier,Relevant
When the order is ready  the supplier sends it with the purchase documents  that is to say the invoice and the acknowledgement of receipt  to the head of the IT department  who sends after all to the service manager,Relevant
Next  both the head of the IT department and the purchasing department compare the purchase order with the delivery and the invoice,Relevant
If one of them finds something incorrect  they contact the supplier in order to solve the problem and then compare it again and contact the supplier again until everything is in order,Relevant
When everything is correct or if everything was right the first time  the Chief Financial Officer has to validate the purchase,Relevant
If he does not validate it  the comparison process between the invoice  the purchase order and the delivery starts again until the amount to be spent aligns with their expectations,Relevant
If he validates the purchase  then he pays the invoice and the process ends,Relevant
