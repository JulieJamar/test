k) The system now waits again and if 30 seconds have not been exceeded the process starts all over again and the system checks again for an AC adapter.,Relevant
Finally in the case that 30 or more seconds have already passed the device automatically turns off.,Relevant
a) When developing a motherboard the hardware design department selects a chipset that meets the requirements.,Relevant
The module used by this department is called design software (Design SW is used at every step in this part).,Irrelevant
After the chipset reference schematics and the chipset documents have been downloaded the same department proceeds with searching for an appropriate motherboard.,Relevant
If the board is not close to the custom specification the search process starts again.,Relevant
Otherwise if a board closest to the custom specification has been found it is then used as a starting schematic.,Relevant
Then simultaneously the design department adds features from other reference boards and removes the useless features from the selected starting schematic.,Relevant
b) In the next step the hardware design department adds peripherals.,Relevant
Then the same department assures if there is an existing BIOS support for the peripherals and at the same time finds all reference boards of the peripherals that are not available on the chipset.,Relevant
For the case that no BIOS support is available the process of adding of peripherals starts all over again.,Relevant
Once the reference boards are found the materials management department (module MM) contacts the manufacturers of the peripherals that are not from the chipset.,Relevant
As a result the manufacturer s information is provided.,Relevant
Once this is done and the BIOS support for all peripherals is available the hardware design department continues to the next step follow c).,Relevant
c) The hardware design department now assures that the reference schematics for every peripheral used are available.,Relevant
If any reference schematic is missing the corresponding peripheral has to be replaced by a new one the process starts over with the activity where peripherals are added.,Relevant
If all reference schematics are available the hardware design department customizes them which triggers the creation of a schematic symbol library.,Relevant
Then the materials management department searches for components in every supplier database.,Relevant
Once all components have been found both the materials management and the hardware design department together gather all components information.,Relevant
Then in parallel the materials management department updates the description the manufacturer information the product numbers and the supplier s information.,Relevant
As a result a preliminary schematic is available.,Relevant
d) Thereafter the materials management department simultaneously generates a preliminary BOM and determines the component s prices using the preliminary schematic and the component s information.,Relevant
After that the same department compares the prices.,Relevant
There are two possible scenarios.,Irrelevant
The chosen components are either offered at best prices or there are cheaper components on the market.,Relevant
If the first case applies please follow f).,Relevant
For the second case that there are cheaper components on the market the hardware design department checks the component s quality.,Relevant
If the quality of the components is worse than this of the components chosen before please follow f).,Relevant
e) For the case that the quality is the same or better the materials management department contacts the new supplier and as a result conditions are negotiated.,Relevant
Alternatively components may not be available via standard supplier and the materials management contacts directly the manufacturer using the quotation data and the manufacturer s contact information.,Relevant
Consequently a quotation is made.,Relevant
Regardless of which of the both cases applies the process goes back to adding the new peripherals.,Relevant
f) In the next step the sales department (using the Sales information system) calculates the price of the prototype and at the same time the price for board quantity of one thousand pieces.,Relevant
Thereafter the hardware design department is responsible for the following procedures components fitment checking board size checking carrying out of preliminary placement creation of 3D model of the board connector s fitment checking and components height checking (some of the input data used are components chipset 3D data and connectors).,Relevant
g) After finishing of all procedures two possible outcomes exist.,Relevant
In the first case problems have occurred after the previous checks.,Relevant
This forces the hardware design department to revise the problematic component(s).,Relevant
If a peripheral needs to be replaced the whole process starts over from adding a new one.,Relevant
If the revision has been successful or the second case applies (when the previous checks are done without any problems) the hardware department finishes the checkup.,Relevant
As a result a checked schematic and a 3D model of the board are available and also the library is updated.,Relevant
The materials management department can now order the components.,Relevant
Once they are received the hardware design department does the final placement.,Relevant
As the final outcomes both the placement and the preliminary layout are done.,Relevant
a) The process starts when a customer has entered the restaurant.,Relevant
The hostess then asks for an existing reservation.,Relevant
If the customer says that he has a reservation she checks the reservation entries using the reservation system.,Relevant
Then in the case that a reservation entry is found in the system the hostess guides the customer to his table.,Relevant
b) In any other case if the customer says that he does not have a reservation or a reservation entry cannot be found the hostess searches for a free table.,Relevant
If a table is found she guides the customer to it.,Relevant
If not she asks him to wait.,Relevant
While he is still waiting the hostess searches again for a free table.,Relevant
In the case that the customer is unwilling to wait he leaves the restaurant and the process is over.,Relevant
c) Once the customer is at the table the waitress brings the menu.,Relevant
After that she asks for orders.,Relevant
The customer either wants to order or not.,Relevant
d) For a customer that wants to order the waitress takes the order using the ordering system.,Relevant
The customer may want something to drink something to eat or both.*,Relevant
In the first case the waitress passes the order to the bartender and once the drinks are ready she serves them.,Relevant
In the second case the same process applies to the meals (here the order is passed to the kitchen).,Relevant
After the order is served the waitress waits until the customer finishes his meal.,Relevant
Once this he has finished she asks again for orders.,Relevant
*The case when a customer orders several meals in one go is ignored.,Irrelevant
e) For a customer that does not want to order the waitress has to determine the reason.,Relevant
The customer either does not have more orders or alternative he is still not ready with his order.,Relevant
f) If the customer is still not ready the waitress waits.,Relevant
Then after the customer has called the waitress or appropriate time is left the waitress asks again for orders.,Relevant
g) If the customer does not want to order more the waitress brings the bill.,Relevant
Here the order and billing data are needed for the billing system.,Relevant
Once the bill is at the table the waitress determines the payment method.,Relevant
Customers normally either want to pay cash in which case the waitress settles the bill immediately or want to pay with credit card.,Relevant
In the second case she brings the mobile POS (mobile POS system).,Relevant
In the next step the customer pays with his credit card and as a result the bill is settled.,Relevant
Finally the customer leaves the restaurant and the process is over.,Relevant
Every weekday morning the database is backed up and then it is checked to see whether the Account Defaulter table has new records.,Relevant
If no new records are found then the process should check the CRM system to see whether new returns have been filed.,Relevant
If new returns exist then register all defaulting accounts and customers.,Relevant
If the defaulting client codes have not been previously advised produce another table of defaulting accounts and send to account management.,Relevant
All of this must be completed by 2 30 pm if it is not then an alert should be sent to the supervisor.,Relevant
Once the new defaulting account report has been completed check the CRM system to see whether new returns have been filed.,Relevant
If new returns have been filed reconcile with the existing account defaulters table.,Relevant
This must be completed by 4 00 pm otherwise a supervisor should be sent a message.,Relevant
The Customer Service Representative sends a Mortgage offer to the customer and waits for a reply.,Relevant
If the customer calls or writes back declining the mortgage the case details are updated and the work is then archived prior to cancellation.,Relevant
If the customer sends back the completed offer documents and attaches all prerequisite documents then the case is moved to administration for completion.,Relevant
If all pre requisite documents are not provided a message is generated to the customer requesting outstanding documents.,Relevant
If no answer is received after 2 weeks the case details are updated prior to archive and cancellation.,Relevant
In November of each year the Coordination Unit at the Town Planning Authority drafts a schedule of meetings for the next calendar year and adds draft dates to all calendars.,Relevant
The Support Officer then checks the dates and suggests modifications.,Relevant
The Coordination Unit then rechecks all dates and looks for potential conflicts.,Relevant
The final schedule of meeting dates is sent to all the independent Committee Members by email who then check their diaries and advise the Coordination Unit of any conflicts.,Relevant
Once the dates are finalized (by the Coordination Unit) the Support Officer updates all group calendars and creates meeting folders for each meeting and ensures all appropriate documents are uploaded to system.,Relevant
Committee Members are advised a week before each meeting to read all related documents.,Relevant
The Committee Members hold their meeting and the Support Office then produces minutes including any Action Points for each Committee Member.,Relevant
Within 5 working days the Coordination Unit must conduct a QA check on the minutes which are then sent to all Committee Members.,Relevant
The Support Officer then updates all departmental records.,Relevant
After the Expense Report is received a new account must be created if the employee does not already have one.,Relevant
The report is then reviewed for automatic approval.,Relevant
Amounts under $200 are automatically approved whereas amounts equal to or over $200 require approval of the supervisor.,Relevant
In case of rejection the employee must receive a rejection notice by email.,Relevant
The reimbursement goes to the employee s direct deposit bank account.,Relevant
If the request is not completed in 7 days then the employee must receive an approval in progress email,Relevant
If the request is not finished within 30 days then the process is stopped and the employee receives an email cancellation notice and must re submit the expense report.,Relevant
After the Process starts a Task is performed to locate and distribute any relevant existing designs both electrical and physical.,Relevant
Next the design of the electrical and physical systems starts in parallel.,Relevant
Any existing or previous Electrical and Physical Designs are inputs to both Activities.,Relevant
Development of either design is interrupted by a successful update of the other design.,Relevant
If interrupted then all current work is stopped and that design must restart.,Relevant
In each department (Electrical Design and Physical Design) any existing designs are reviewed resulting in an Update Plan for their respective designs (i.e. one in Electrical and another in Physical).,Relevant
Using the Update Plan and the existing Draft of the Electrical Physical Design a revised design is created.,Relevant
Once completed the revised design is tested.,Relevant
If the design fails the test then it is sent back to the first Activity (in the department) to review and create a new Update Plan.,Relevant
If the design passes the test then it tells the other department that they need to restart their work.,Relevant
When both of the designs have been revised they are combined and tested.,Relevant
If the combined design fails the test then they are both sent back to the beginning to initiate another design cycle if the designs pass the test then they are deemed complete and are then sent to the manufacturing Process [a separate Process].,Relevant
The goods are divided into two types cold and warm.,Irrelevant
All cold goods are simply taken from the storehouse whereas warm goods are prepared half an hour before the delivery starts.,Relevant
After the customer has chosen several gold and warm goods he can proceed to the checkout.,Relevant
The checkout requires the selection of 1) a customer profile 2) the delivery time and 3) the credit card number which is debited at the bank.,Irrelevant
Afterwards the order is saved and the customer receives confirmation e mail.,Relevant
The customer should be able to cancel orders at any time until one hour before the delivery time.,Relevant
The catering service has to check open orders frequently to prepare warm goods in time for delivery.,Relevant
After all cold and warm goods have been collected or prepared they are delivered to the customer.,Relevant
The next day after the delivery an e mail is send to the customer asking for feedback about the quality of the service and goods.,Relevant
A travel agency wants to establish a booking service.,Irrelevant
The service is triggered by an incoming request and can return two different messages either an unavailable notification or a confirmation.,Irrelevant
The business process of the service starts by first checking the request.,Relevant
If for certain reasons the request can only be handled manually by an employee (e.g. group travels) a sub process for manual handling is activated.,Relevant
Otherwise the process enters a transactional sub process where a bus and hotel booking occur in parallel.,Relevant
However if one of these fails the transaction is canceled a log message is written and the unavailability message is sent.,Relevant
If both bookings succeed an attraction is booked by invoking another service.,Relevant
The only thing that could go wrong is a timeout i.e. the attraction booking service is not responding in time.,Relevant
If this happens a manual handling of the booking has to be made.,Relevant
If the attraction booking invocation succeeds a confirmation is sent.,Relevant
The manual handling always results in a successful booking in which case a confirmation message is sent.,Relevant
End of study projects in an industrial environment is a mandatory part in the Bachelor curriculum.,Irrelevant
The students are not yet involved in the planning phase where each research group interacts with its industry partners.,Irrelevant
As the project proposals have to be handed in to the faculty by 30 June the research group starts planning in the beginning of June.,Irrelevant
The group sends request to all of its partners and waits for their proposals for at most a week.,Relevant
The group selects the two most interesting proposals and starts planning the details for these two proposals.,Relevant
First the proposal is worked over in several iterations ,Relevant
The group updates the proposal document before it is sent to the partner who in turn updates it and sends it back.,Relevant
Once the document has reached a final status it is handed in to the faculty.,Relevant
The faculty decides which of the proposals will be accepted.,Relevant
The outcome of this decision results in one of two messages Either the project proposal was rejected or it was accepted.,Relevant
In the latter case the group announces this positive result to the corresponding partner.,Relevant
After the reception of a meeting remainder a new account must be created if the employee does not already have one.,Relevant
The report is then reviewed for automatic approval.,Relevant
Amounts under $200 are automatically approved whereas amounts equal to or over $200 require approval of the supervisor.,Relevant
In case of rejection the employee must receive a rejection notice by email.,Relevant
The reimbursement goes to the employee’s direct deposit bank account.,Relevant
If the request is not completed in 7 days then the employee must receive an “approval in progress” email If the request is not finished within 30 days then the process is stopped.,Relevant

What follow is the description of the operation,Irrelevant
When a customer phones in and specifies the food items (using item description assuming it is unique) that he she wants to order the total order amounts will be calculated and the customer will be told about this,Relevant
The information about the new order will be stored and the order is also send to the kitchen for preparing the food,Relevant
When the kitchen finish preparing the food for a particular order it will inform the OHD that the order is ready,Relevant
The OHD staff will update the status of the order to Ready and a delivery instruction which contain the order information (item description is printed instead of item code) and the delivery address will be generated and sent to the delivery personnel who is responsible for delivering the food to the customer,Relevant
Here at Complete Automotive we have a thorough repair process to ensure the best results for our customers,Irrelevant
Our repair process is as follows,Irrelevant
First our technicians inspect your vehicle to determine what type of damage exists,Relevant
With this information we can use estimation software to provide an estimate,Relevant
Keep in mind not all damage is seen while being inspected normally the hidden damages are seen after the vehicle is disassembled,Irrelevant
During the disassembly process we are preparing your vehicle for repair,Relevant
It is at this stage that hidden damages are often found,Relevant
Any hidden damages require scheduling the insurance company to re inspect and order additional parts,Relevant
The repair process can only begin when the shop receives all the parts,Relevant
At the parts order stage the availability of parts is checked and parts are ordered in a timely manner so repairs can begin on schedule,Relevant
The structural damage occurred during an accident must be repaired first,Relevant
Our trained technicians will use a computer based measurement system to analyze the frame of your vehicle allowing us to accurately return your vehicle to manufacturer requirements,Relevant
In the body repair department technicians replace the exterior panels and all metal finishing that is required,Relevant
Sheet metal is installed and aligned before the vehicle goes to the paint preparations department,Relevant
The paint preparation is a very important step in the refinishing process,Irrelevant
During this paint preparation our experienced paint specialists prepare the panels and then prime paint and seal to ensure the highest quality finished product,Relevant
In the reassembly area final moldings and detail pieces are put back on the vehicle and the vehicle’s system is checked,Relevant
In this step the vehicle is almost complete and ready for delivery,Irrelevant
During the Detail Process the vehicle must be thoroughly cleaned to remove any dust dirt etc,Relevant
The vehicle will then be road tested to ensure everything is working properly before a final inspection assures the vehicle is restored to its pre accident condition,Relevant
Delivery is the final step in the repair process,Relevant
It is at this point we explain the repair bill and the final paper work is completed when the customer arrives to pick up their vehicle,Relevant
The customer drives away in the vehicle that has been restored to its previous condition before the accident,Irrelevant
Categorize what type of work is needed and schedule for repair.,Relevant
Arrival for repairs  We will verify with you the damage to be fixed and go over all other pertinent information.,Relevant
Repair Planning  Your vehicle is disassembled and a complete and accurate plan is made on how to fix your vehicle.  ,Relevant
Parts are ordered and then we will call and discuss the repairs as well as give you a guaranteed completion date.,Relevant
Update Call   Once all parts have been received and matched we will call you with an update.,Relevant
Body repair   We fix from the inside out so making sure the structure is properly aligned is key to the exterior fit and finish.,Relevant
Damaged panels are either replaced or repaired during this stage.,Relevant
A team leader ensures quality control before moving to the next stage.,Relevant
Paint  A primer and sealer is applied for corrosion protection.,Relevant
Then a base coat and two coats of clear.,Relevant
Build   Final parts (i.e. trim and molding) are put back on the vehicle.  ,Relevant
Functions are checked then the interior and exterior of the vehicle is cleaned before another inspection.,Relevant
Final Check   Your adviser will do a final inspection and process the remaining paperwork,Relevant
Final delivery   We will go over the repairs with you and help process the rental car return,Relevant
1. Estimate The process of collision repair starts with an inspection of your vehicle.,Relevant
It will be done by an estimator at the body shop where the repair will take place.,Relevant
After the paperwork is finished and the result of the inspection is produced photos of the car will be taken.,Relevant
All the necessary information will then be forwarded to the insurance company and the customer.,Relevant
2. Disassembly In this step your insurance provider can make a request for the teardown of the vehicle.,Relevant
The request is done to make sure all damages are accurately documented and find out if the vehicle should still be repaired.,Irrelevant
Once the customer and insurance company have provided authorization for the repair the auto body shop can now order the necessary parts.,Relevant
During the collision repair process an electronic measuring system analyzes the car to restore it according to the factory specifications.,Relevant
This is an important step as it ensures the car frame remains structurally sound.,Irrelevant
If needed wheel alignment and other suspension repairs will be done.,Relevant
All mechanical repairs should be completed along with the structural repairs.,Relevant
4. Paint Prep Paint preparation is a crucial step in the refinishing process of all types of vehicles.,Irrelevant
The body shop will prepare all panels for painting before priming and sealing.,Relevant
This creates better adhesion when the top color and additional clear coating are applied to your car.,Relevant
5. Reassembly In the reassembly area all detail pieces and final moldings are returned to the vehicle.,Relevant
All the systems in the car are also inspected during this step.,Relevant
Once your car reaches this stage it means the repair is almost finished and the car is almost ready to be delivered to the client.,Irrelevant
6. Quality Control Inspection The vehicle gets a wash and thorough interior cleaning once all parts have been reinstalled.,Relevant
Surfaces are cleaned and the body paint is polished. In addition to doing a physical inspection the body shop personnel will also test drive your car.,Relevant
This is to make sure that there are no driving problems that may be related to the repaired part s of the vehicle.,Irrelevant
7. Delivery This is the final step in the collision repair process.,Relevant
Once the client arrives at the shop to pick up their car the final paperwork is released and the bill is explained.,Relevant
The customer then drives home in the car that has been returned to its pre accident state.,Irrelevant
Every weekday morning the database is backed up and then it is checked to see whether the Account Defaulter table has new records.,Relevant
If no new records are found then the process should check the CRM system to see whether new returns have been filed.,Relevant
If new returns exist then register all defaulting accounts and customers.,Relevant
If the defaulting client codes have not been previously advised produce another table of defaulting accounts and send to account management.,Relevant
All of this must be completed by 2 30 pm if it is not then an alert should be sent to the supervisor.,Relevant
Once the new defaulting account report has been completed check the CRM system to see whether new returns have been filed.,Relevant
If new returns have been filed reconcile with the existing account defaulters table.,Relevant
This must be completed by 4 00 pm otherwise a supervisor should be sent a message.,Relevant
The Customer Service Representative sends a Mortgage offer to the customer and waits for a reply.,Relevant
If the customer calls or writes back declining the mortgage the case details are updated and the work is then archived prior to cancellation.,Relevant
If the customer sends back the completed offer documents and attaches all prerequisite documents then the case is moved to administration for completion.,Relevant
If all pre requisite documents are not provided a message is generated to the customer requesting outstanding documents.,Relevant
If no answer is received after 2 weeks the case details are updated prior to archive and cancellation.,Relevant

Final Check   Your adviser will do a final inspection and process the remaining paperwork.,Relevant
Final delivery   We will go over the repairs with you and help process the rental car return.,Relevant
1. Estimate The process of collision repair starts with an inspection of your vehicle. .,Relevant
It will be done by an estimator at the body shop where the repair will take place. .,Relevant
After the paperwork is finished and the result of the inspection is produced photos of the car will be taken. .,Relevant
All the necessary information will then be forwarded to the insurance company and the customer..,Relevant
2. Disassembly In this step your insurance provider can make a request for the teardown of the vehicle. .,Relevant
The request is done to make sure all damages are accurately documented and find out if the vehicle should still be repaired. .,Irrelevant
Once the customer and insurance company have provided authorization for the repair the auto body shop can now order the necessary parts..,Relevant
During the collision repair process an electronic measuring system analyzes the car to restore it according to the factory specifications. .,Relevant
This is an important step as it ensures the car frame remains structurally sound. .,Irrelevant
If needed wheel alignment and other suspension repairs will be done. .,Relevant
All mechanical repairs should be completed along with the structural repairs..,Relevant
4. Paint Prep Paint preparation is a crucial step in the refinishing process of all types of vehicles. .,Irrelevant
The body shop will prepare all panels for painting before priming and sealing. .,Relevant
This creates better adhesion when the top color and additional clear coating are applied to your car..,Relevant

The hiring process begins by identifying a need within your organization.,Relevant
This need could vary from filling a vacated position better managing a team’s workload or expanding the reach of organizational tasks.,Irrelevant
Positions are in other words either newly formed or recently vacated.,Irrelevant
Once an organization identifies a hiring need it should begin recruitment.,Relevant
In the case of newly formed positions organizations should clearly identify how the new role aligns with its goals and business plan.,Relevant
Organizations should also keep relevant internal teams and employees apprised of the new position at each stage of the hiring process.,Relevant
It’s important that all those involved in the hiring decision agree to the hiring process steps and appropriate communication channels.,Irrelevant
Recruitment also includes strategizing how to publicize the new position both internally and externally criteria for initial candidate screening what the interview process will look like and who will conduct interviews.,Irrelevant
The hiring staff should start by generating a job description that includes a prioritized list of job requirements special qualifications desired characteristics and requisite experience.,Relevant
The job description should also include information regarding salary and benefits.,Irrelevant
Identifying highly qualified potential candidates begins internally.,Relevant
Start therefore by notifying current employees of the opening.,Relevant
Advertising the job may stop there if you are determined to fill the position internally.,Relevant
If however you are interested in external candidates you should include this information when you notify internally.,Relevant
External publicity will likely consist of utilizing a combination of the company’s website and social media platforms job posting sites like LinkedIn job fairs industry publications and events local newspaper advertisements and word of mouth recruitment.,Relevant
Beyond simple job posts the hiring staff should reach out directly to desirable candidates via LinkedIn social media and job fairs.,Relevant
Active recruitment will help generate applications from potential candidates who are not actively searching for new jobs but may be perfect for the available position.,Irrelevant
Your organization likely already has a mechanism in place to receive applications via email an applicant tracking system (ATS) etc.,Relevant
In many cases the review process begins with Human Resource representatives who review the applications and eliminate any candidate who does not meet the minimum requirements for the position or the company more generally.,Relevant
In other instances the hiring team or hiring manager may prefer to review each application.,Relevant
Once a batch of qualified applications are assembled the hiring staff should review the remaining candidates and identify those they want to interview.,Relevant
Initial interviews typically begin with phone calls with HR representatives.,Relevant
Phone interviews determine if applicants possess the requisite qualifications to fill the position and align with an organization’s culture and values.,Irrelevant
Phone interviews enable organizations to further pare down the list of candidates while expending company resources efficiently.,Irrelevant
Depending on the size of the organization and hiring committee one or several interviews are scheduled for those remaining candidates.,Relevant
Interviews include Early interviews are typically one on one in person interviews between the applicants and the hiring manager.,Irrelevant
Early interviews conversations typically focus on applicants’ experience skills work history and availability.,Irrelevant
Additional interviews with management staff executives and other members of the organization can be either one on one or group interviews with the hiring committee.,Irrelevant
They may be formal or casual on site off site or online via Skype Google Hangouts etc.,Irrelevant
Additional interviews are more in depth for example in interviews between a candidate and multiple members of the hiring team interviewer each member of the hiring team focuses on a specific topic or aspect of the job to avoid redundancy and ensure an in depth conversation about the role and the candidates qualifications and experience.,Irrelevant
Note at this stage you should also inform the candidates you elect not to request an interview that the search has moved forward and they are no longer under consideration.,Relevant
Final interviews often include conversations with the company’s senior leadership or a more in depth discussion with an interviewer from an earlier stage in the hiring process.,Irrelevant
Final interviews are typically extended only to a very small pool of top candidates.,Irrelevant
Once the interviews are completed or during their completion company’s often assign applicants one or more standardized tests.,Relevant
These exams measure a wide range of variables including personality traits problem solving ability reasoning reading comprehension emotional intelligence and more.,Irrelevant
Your initial job posting should indicate that all candidates are subject to a background check.,Relevant
Background checks review candidates’ criminal record verify employment history and eligibility and run credit checks.,Irrelevant
Some organizations also check social media accounts (Facebook Twitter etc ) to make sure potential employees are likely to represent the company in a professional manner.,Relevant
Drug testing may also be warranted depending on the position.,Relevant
After conducting background and reference checks the hiring staff identifies their top choice.,Relevant
The hiring staff should also select a backup candidate in case the top choice declines the offer or negotiations fail to produce a signed offer letter.,Relevant
In the event that no candidates meet the hiring criteria the hiring staff should determine whether or not to start the hiring process over.,Relevant
If so the hiring staff should discuss whether or not to adjust or alter the hiring process in order to yield more favorable candidates.,Relevant
Reference checks should verify any pertinent information shared by the candidate about previous employment job performance experience responsibilities workplace conduct etc.,Relevant
A typical question to ask references is “Would you rehire this person?” Once a top candidate is identified the organization should extend an initial offer.,Irrelevant
The offer letter should include the position’s salary benefits paid time off start date potential severance pay working remotely policy included company equipment and other terms and conditions of employment.,Irrelevant
Negotiations are likely to follow.,Irrelevant
Therefore the hiring staff should determine internally which elements of the offer letter are negotiable and which are not.,Relevant
It is typical for terms like salary flexible work schedule and working remotely to be negotiable.,Irrelevant
After negotiations once the candidate accepts the job offer they are hired.,Relevant
An accepted offer letter begins a process of filling out and filing paperwork related to employment.,Relevant
Forms and paperwork might include Form W 4 Form I 9 and E Verify State Withholding and Registrations A checklist with all required paperwork to be completed by new employees An organization’s employee handbook … Hiring a new employee does not conclude the hiring process.,Irrelevant
Onboarding your new worker in a welcoming and professional way will help integrate them in a manner that lays the groundwork for a long term productive relationship between them and your company.,Relevant
A welcome letter is strongly advised.,Irrelevant
From there relevant management should reach out to the employee before their start date to welcome them to the organization.,Relevant
Their work space should be prepared cleaned and equipped with the necessary credentials and equipment before their first day.,Relevant
If an orientation is part of the onboarding process make sure your employee has a clear understanding of the expectations and scheduling of those events.,Relevant
Lastly consider assigning your new employee a mentor which will help them settle in to their new position and organization and set them up for long term growth and success.,Relevant
A document management system acts as the corners stone for indexing storing routing and approving invoices.,Irrelevant
Utilising a document management system provides the foundation for an efficient invoice approval process.,Irrelevant
Invoices can arrive in your organisation through the postal system email attachments or even still through fax.,Relevant
Invoices can be compiled in a document management system from multiple sources by importing directly from a scanner storing directly from an email client or automatically pulling the invoices from a file folder.,Relevant
Once the invoices are in a document management tray (rather than paper in a tray on your desk) the documents can then be indexed with the associated data such as supplier name invoice number etc.,Relevant
Through machine learning this indexing becomes automatically extracted and prepopulates index fields reducing the need for manually keying in of data.,Irrelevant
When the necessary indexing has been approved by a member of the accounts team the team member can then take responsibility to route invoices to relevant approvers.,Relevant
Defined invoices can automatically be routed to approvers based on business rules to eliminate the need for manual routing.,Relevant
When an invoice requires attention approvers can receive an email alert and in app notification accessible via mobile tablet or computer.,Relevant
Invoices with corresponding purchase orders can be automatically flagged as approved to pay.,Relevant
Approvers can view invoices within a browser based app on any device approve the invoices in full or part amount add notes reject or re route the invoice all configurable based on business rules.,Relevant
Approved invoices are routed back to the accounts team alerted by email or in app notifications.,Relevant
Invoices are then booked for payment.,Relevant
The invoices have been indexed approved and stored in the document management system they are easily searchable and accessible.,Irrelevant
Related documents can be displayed at the click of a mouse.,Irrelevant
Desired information can be exported to any accounting system with information able to travel both ways through intelligent integration.,Irrelevant
Important data such as if an invoice has been paid from your accounting system back into the document management system to close the loop on the invoice process.,Irrelevant
Organisations can gain valuable insights by utilising the ability to run multiple reports on approval times invoice volumes and department performance and other desired metrics.,Irrelevant
The business receives an invoice from a vendor or supplier.,Relevant
The invoice is verified by the staff member responsible for procuring that particular type of product or service.,Relevant
Verification typically involves matching the invoice with the appropriate purchase order (PO) for the product or service.,Irrelevant
Invoice irregularities can include pricing discrepancies and missing information such as a PO number.,Irrelevant
The invoice is sent to the relevant parties to address correct the irregularity after which it’s sent through the approval workflow again.,Relevant
The invoice is sent to relevant personnel for approval.,Relevant
Depending on the products and services being ordered or the billed amount this approval chain can be dynamically determined.,Irrelevant
The approved invoice is sent to the person department responsible for accounts payable for processing and the vendor is paid.,Relevant
A permanent record of the transaction is added to the organization’s books.,Relevant
 That’s it – the whole process in six quick steps.,Irrelevant
The invoice approval process may seem simple but multiply this by dozens or hundreds of vendors and thousands of invoices and you quickly have a complex situation on your hands.,Irrelevant
The user will be prompted to input the Process Name Unique Name and an optional short description.,Relevant
Then the Specify Entry Criteria step allows the user to define criteria that need to be met for the approval process to take place.,Relevant
Choose Criteria are met to set filter criteria that records should meet to trigger and enter the approval process.,Irrelevant
Add the filter criteria on the fields provided.,Relevant
Leave the filter blank if all the records in there will be included in the process.,Relevant
Choose Formula Evaluates to True if a formula will be required to determine the records that will enter in the process.,Relevant
Click on New field update  email  task select Conditions and click on Save.,Relevant
Define Approval Steps Here the current user can assign approval requests to several other users through an automatic user field.,Relevant
Bear in mind that the administrator has the sole responsibility to edit the process.,Irrelevant
Enter the condition for approval of the records then save.,Relevant
The administrator can edit this anytime.,Irrelevant
Enter the default actions or conditions that will lead to rejection.,Relevant
After this step the process will be automatically activated.,Relevant
Hence no more additional steps can be added or changed.,Irrelevant
Preapproval is as close as you can get to confirming your creditworthiness without having a purchase contract in place.,Irrelevant
You will complete a mortgage application and the lender will verify the information you provide.,Relevant
They’ll also perform a credit check.,Relevant
If you’re preapproved you’ll receive a preapproval letter which is an offer (but not a commitment) to lend you a specific amount good for 90 days.,Relevant
An insurance claim is a formal request by a policyholder to an insurance company for coverage or compensation for a covered loss or policy event.,Irrelevant
The insurance company validates or denies the claim.,Relevant
If it is approved the insurance company will issue payment to the insured or an approved interested party on behalf of the insured.,Relevant
Your customer buys an item on your site with a credit or debit card.,Relevant
That information goes through the payment gateway which encrypts the data to keep it private and sends it to the payment processor.,Relevant
The payment processor sends a request to the customer’s issuing bank to check to see that they have enough credit to pay for your stuff.,Relevant
The issuer responds with a yes (an approval) or a no (a denial).,Relevant
The payment processor sends the answer back to you that the sale was approved and also tells your merchant bank to credit your account.,Relevant
The buyer validates the shopping cart.,Relevant
The merchant website redirects the buyer to the payment gateway.,Relevant
This redirection is done via an HTML POST form in HTTPS.,Irrelevant
The parameters of the form are described in the chapter Generating a payment form.,Irrelevant
When the parameters and their signature have been verified the payment method selection page appears .,Relevant
If the payment method has been specified in the form the buyer moves on directly to step 6.,Relevant
The buyer selects a payment method.,Relevant
The buyer clicks Validate.,Relevant
The buyer enters the number and the expiry date of their card.,Relevant
If the card has a security (CVV) code it must be specified.,Relevant
During a payment by CB card co branded VISA or MASTERCARD the buyer chooses the logo of the brand he or she wishes to use for the payment.,Relevant
The payment gateway automatically detects the brand(s) associated with the number of the used card.,Relevant
If several brands are available a drop down list will appear to the right of the entry field.,Relevant
The logo chosen by the merchant will appear first on the list.,Relevant
If only one brand is available the logo will appear automatically.,Relevant
If you need help you can click the ? icon to the right of the entry field.,Relevant
He or she and confirms the entry by clicking Validate.,Relevant
If the merchant and the buyer’s card are enrolled in the 3D Secure program the payment will be authenticated with 3D Secure.,Relevant
An authorization request is sent to the buyer’s bank the issuer in addition to internal fraud verification on the payment gateway.,Relevant
In case of success a summary page is presented to the buyer with a summary of transaction details.,Relevant
The logo of the brand selected by the buyer will appear on the receipt.,Relevant
A button allowing to return to the shop is presented.,Relevant
In case of failure a message is displayed.,Relevant
The buyer is informed of the rejection of the payment request.,Relevant
A button allowing to cancel and return to the shop is presented.,Relevant
If you have configured a number of additional attempts that is higher than 0 in your Merchant Back Office the buyer will be able to retry to finalize their payment.,Relevant
If he or she accepts the payment process resumes at the stage of payment method selection.,Relevant
Once the additional attempts have been used the payment is permanently rejected.,Relevant
When a supplier payment needs to be generated the recording of the invoice received from the supplier (or other payment request documentation such as a check request) is approved and entered as an invoice into the accounts payable module in Oracle.,Relevant
Invoices can be entered prior to the date the check is to be produced.,Relevant
Based on the payment terms entered (for example Immediate Net 30) the invoice is selected to be included in the payment process which is done overnight by RF central office.,Relevant
The payment process generates the check.,Relevant
Generally the floor pan is the largest body component to which a multitude of panels and braces will subsequently be either welded or bolted.,Irrelevant
As it moves down the assembly line held in place by clamping fixtures the shell of the vehicle is built.,Irrelevant
First the left and right quarter panels are robotically disengaged from pre staged shipping containers and placed onto the floor pan where they are stabilized with positioning fixtures and welded.,Relevant
The front and rear door pillars roof and body side panels are assembled in the same fashion.,Relevant
The shell of the automobile assembled in this section of the process lends itself to the use of robots because articulating arms can easily introduce various component braces and panels to the floor pan and perform a high number of weld operations in a time frame and with a degree of accuracy no human workers could ever approach.,Relevant
Robots can pick and load 200 pound (90 8 kilograms) roof panels and place them precisely in the proper weld position with tolerance variations held to within 001 of an inch.,Irrelevant
Moreover robots can also tolerate the smoke weld flashes and gases created during this phase of production.,Irrelevant
As the body moves from the isolated weld area of the assembly line subsequent body components including fully assembled doors deck lids hood panel fenders trunk lid and bumper reinforcements are installed.,Relevant
Although robots help workers place these components onto the body shell the workers provide the proper fit for most of the bolt on functional parts using pneumatically assisted tools.,Relevant
Manufacturers first clean the beans to remove unwanted material.,Relevant
Next they roast and winnow the beans to obtain the edible part called “nib ” which is the edible part of the bean.,Relevant
Thereafter they melt the nib and add sugar and flavor to it.,Relevant
The liquid chocolate so produced is either stored or molded into the required solid form.,Relevant
The process of making chocolate starts with the cocoa beans being passed through a machine that removes dried cocoa pulp pieces of pod and other extraneous material.,Relevant
The beans are carefully weighed and blended according to specifications.,Relevant
Finally the last vestiges of wood jute fibres sand and even the finest dust are extracted by powerful vacuum equipment.,Relevant
The separated cocoa bean husks are passed on to the chemical industry which extracts valuable compounds.,Relevant
To bring out the characteristic chocolate aroma the beans are roasted in large rotary cylinders.,Relevant
Depending upon the variety of the beans and the desired end result the roasting lasts from 30 minutes to two hours at temperatures of 250 degrees Fahrenheit and higher.,Relevant
As the beans turn over and over their moisture content drops their color changes to a rich brown and the characteristic aroma of chocolate becomes evident.,Irrelevant
Although all steps are important proper roasting is one of the keys to good flavor.,Irrelevant
The cocoa beans are cooled quickly and their thin shells which have become brittle by roasting are removed.,Relevant
A giant winnowing machine that passes the beans between serrated cones so they are cracked rather than crushed.,Relevant
In the process a series of mechanical sieves separate the broken pieces into large and small grains while fans blow away the thin light shell from the meat or nibs.,Relevant
Here s where the first secrets of the chocolate manufacturer comes in. .,Irrelevant
The nibs are blended combining as many as 8 10 varieties. .,Relevant
It is control of these subtle mixtures that maintain constant quality and brings out the flavor of each particular variety of chocolate. .,Irrelevant
The nibs which contain about 53 % cocoa butter pass through refining mills and are ground between large grinding stones or heavy steel discs creating a cocoa paste. .,Relevant
The paste is subjected to hydraulic pressure and the cocoa butter flowing out is a pure and valuable fat with a marked aroma after filtering and purifying it looks very much like ordinary butter. .,Relevant
To make cocoa powder chocolate liquor is pumped into hydraulic presses weighing up to 25 tons and when the pressure is applied 80% cocoa butter is removed. .,Relevant
The fat drains away through metallic screens as a yellow liquid and then is collected for use in chocolate manufacturing. .,Relevant
Cocoa butter unique among vegetable fats is a solid at normal room temperature and melts at 89 to 93 degrees Fahrenheit… just below body temperature. .,Irrelevant
With proper storage conditions cocoa butter can be kept for years without spoiling. .,Irrelevant
The cake which is left may eventually be made into cocoa powder by being further crushed milled and finely sifted.,Irrelevant
Three or five vertically mounted steel rollers rotate in opposite directions.,Irrelevant
Under heavy pressure they pulverize the tiny particles of cocoa and sugar down to a size of approx 30 microns (One micron is a thousandth part of a millimeter!) Milk chocolate is made by adding milk sugar cocoa butter and other ingredients to the bitter chocolate liquor.,Relevant
At this point Chocolate is prepared in according to individual recipes.,Irrelevant
The blending of the various types of cocoa pastes and other ingredients determine the ultimate taste.,Irrelevant
The ingredients go into a mixer with rotating kneading arms until the result is a homogeneous paste like mixture with a pleasant taste but it still feels gritty to the palate.,Relevant
Conching machines knead the Chocolate Paste .,Relevant
This process develops flavors and changes the texture during controlled temperatures.,Irrelevant
It’s the last and most important refining process which allows the separate flavors of the individual ingredients to combine.,Irrelevant
Conches [the paddles of the early machines resembled conch shells] are equipped with heavy rollers that plow back and forth through the chocolate paste anywhere from a few hours to several days.,Irrelevant
Contemporary technologies can grind the chocolate particles extremely fine which can reduce conching times.,Irrelevant
Swiss and Belgian chocolates are conched as much as 96 hours.,Irrelevant
Some chocolates are not conched at all or for only 4 to 12 hours.,Irrelevant
Under regulated speeds and temperatures these rollers can produce different degrees of agitation and aeration to create distinct chocolate flavors.,Relevant
The process can eliminate any remaining bitterness by aerating the chocolate and expelling volatile acids.,Irrelevant
Additional cocoa butter and lecithin are added which help to achieve the characteristic velvet smoothness.,Relevant
And as the ultimate homogeneity of the ingredients is developed a soft film of cocoa butter begins to form around each of the extremely small particles.,Relevant
The chocolate no longer seems sandy but dissolves meltingly on the tongue.,Irrelevant
It has attained the outstanding purity which gives it its reputation.,Irrelevant
The last stage of conching Swiss or Belgian chocolate is a magnificent sight… huge paddles rolling slowly through great vats of chocolate smooth and creamy and thick.,Relevant
Circular conches use a rotary movement and can hold 9 tons of chocolate.,Irrelevant
They are the most efficient of the conch machines In some manufacturing setups there is an emulsifying operation that either takes the place of conching [or supplements conching].,Relevant
Emulsifying is breaking up sugar crystals and other particles in the chocolate mixture to give it a fine velvety smoothness.,Irrelevant
The machine works like an eggbeater.,Irrelevant
Chocolate is Tempered by Heating Cooling & Reheating This thickens the chocolate and imparts the right flow properties for filling the moulds.,Relevant
This complex operation is performed in the tempering plant and is necessary to give the final chocolate product a delicate composition a uniform structure and a well rounded flavor.,Irrelevant
The storage life is also increased in this way.,Irrelevant
The still warm conched chocolate is placed in a tempering machine so that it can be slowly and steadily cooled.,Relevant
Cooling chocolate at a fixed rate keeps the flavor from being compromised and prevents separation when the chocolate is poured into bar molds.,Irrelevant
Proper tempering also results in a silky sheen and crisp snap when broken… another sign of a superior quality chocolate bar.,Irrelevant
The tempered chocolate is poured into molds of many sizes from individual sized bars to a ten pound blocks used by confectionery manufacturers.,Relevant
Liquid Chocolate is Temporary Stored A necessary step conches are always filled with the largest amounts of chocolate for efficiency the molding machines can only accept small amounts of chocolate paste at one time in order to shape it into bars chocolates and other products.,Relevant
Chocolate is frequently shipped in a liquid state to other food manufacturers or it can be stored for short periods of time.,Relevant
For longer periods it is solidified usually in the form of hundredweight blocks.,Relevant
These blocks must be reheated before further processing so that they liquefy again.,Irrelevant
The cocoa beans are cleaned to remove all extraneous material.,Relevant
To bring out the chocolate flavour and colour the beans are roasted.,Relevant
The temperature time and degree of moisture involved in roasting depend on the type of beans used and the sort of chocolate or product required from the process.,Irrelevant
A winnowing machine is used to remove the shells from the beans to leave just the cocoa nibs.,Relevant
The cocoa nibs undergo alkalisation usually with potassium carbonate to develop the flavour and colour.,Relevant
The nibs are then milled to create cocoa liquor (cocoa particles suspended in cocoa butter).,Relevant
The temperature and degree of milling varies according to the type of nib used and the product required.,Irrelevant
Manufacturers generally use more than one type of bean in their products and therefore the different beans have to be blended together to the required formula.,Relevant
The cocoa liquor is pressed to extract the cocoa butter leaving a solid mass called cocoa presscake.,Relevant
The amount of butter extracted from the liquor is controlled by the manufacturer to produce presscake with different proportions of fat.,Relevant
The processing now takes two different directions.,Irrelevant
The cocoa butter is used in the manufacture of chocolate.,Irrelevant
The cocoa presscake is broken into small pieces to form kibbled presscake which is then pulverised to form cocoa powder.,Relevant
Cocoa liquor is used to produce chocolate through the addition of cocoa butter.,Relevant
Other ingredients such as sugar milk emulsifying agents and cocoa butter equivalents are also added and mixed.,Relevant
The proportions of the different ingredients depend on the type of chocolate being made.,Irrelevant
The mixture then undergoes a refining process by travelling through a series of rollers until a smooth paste is formed.,Relevant
Refining improves the texture of the chocolate.,Irrelevant
The next process conching further develops flavour and texture.,Relevant
Conching is a kneading or smoothing process.,Irrelevant
The speed duration and temperature of the kneading affect the flavour.,Irrelevant
An alternative to conching is an emulsifying process using a machine that works like an egg beater.,Irrelevant
The mixture is then tempered or passed through a heating cooling and reheating process.,Relevant
This prevents discolouration and fat bloom in the product by preventing certain crystalline formations of cocoa butter developing.,Irrelevant
The mixture is then put into moulds or used for enrobing fillings and cooled in a cooling chamber.,Relevant
The chocolate is then packaged for distribution to retail outlets.,Relevant
Whole corn kernels are ground into a form of flour or meal.,Relevant
The meal is mainly starch.,Irrelevant
A starch is a carbohydrate made up of long chains of sugar molecules.,Irrelevant
Liquefaction Water is added to the meal to make slurry.,Relevant
The slurry is heated to break the long starch molecules into smaller pieces.,Relevant
The enzyme alpha amylase is added to catalyze (or speed up) the breakdown of the starch molecules.,Relevant
Saccharification Starch molecule pieces are broken down into the simple sugar glucose.,Relevant
This reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme called glucoamylase.,Relevant
Fermentation Single celled microorganisms called yeast are added to the slurry.,Relevant
Fermentation is the biochemical process that occurs when yeast break down glucose.,Irrelevant
Yeast gets energy from glucose.,Irrelevant
As a result ethanol is produced.,Relevant
Distillation and Dehydration The product of the fermentation process is only 10 15% ethanol.,Irrelevant
It must be concentrated to become pure (100%) ethanol.,Irrelevant
Ethanol has a lower boiling point than water.,Irrelevant
It is selectively evaporated and condensed in a process called distillation.,Relevant
This process produces ethanol that is 95% pure.,Irrelevant
The remaining 5% of the mixture is water.,Irrelevant
The mixture is strained and dehydrated to produce pure ethanol.,Relevant
Denaturation A small amount of gasoline is added to fuel ethanol to make it undrinkable.,Relevant
Most ethanol is produced using a four step process ? .,Irrelevant
The ethanol feedstock (crops or plants) are ground up for easier processing .,Relevant
Sugar is dissolved from the ground material or the starch or cellulose is converted into sugar.,Relevant
This is done through a cooking process.,Irrelevant
Microbes such as yeast or bacteria feed on the sugar producing ethanol in a process called fermentation essentially the same way beer and wine are made.,Irrelevant
Carbon dioxide is a byproduct of this fermentation .,Irrelevant
The ethanol is distilled to achieve a high concentration.,Relevant
Gasoline or another additive is added so it cannot be consumed by humans a process called denaturation.,Relevant
This way the ethanol also avoids a tax on beverage alcohol.,Irrelevant
The sifted flour is poured into an industrial mixer.,Relevant
Temperature controlled water is piped into the mixer.,Relevant
This mixture is called gluten and gives bread its elasticity.,Irrelevant
A pre measured amount of yeast is added.,Relevant
Yeast is actually a tiny organism which feeds off the sugars in the grain and emits carbon dioxide.,Irrelevant
The growth of the yeast produces gas bubbles which leaven the bread.,Irrelevant
Depending on the type of bread to be made other ingredients are also poured into the mixer.,Relevant
Modern mixers can process up to 2 000 pounds (908 kg) of dough per minute.,Irrelevant
The mixer is essentially an enclosed drum that rotates at speeds between 35 to 75 revolutions per minute.,Irrelevant
Inside the drum mechanical arms knead the dough to the desired consistency in a matter of seconds.,Relevant
Although modern bread production is highly computerized the ability of the mixing staff to judge the elasticity and appearance of the dough is critical.,Irrelevant
Experienced personnel will be able to determine the consistency by the sound of the dough as it rolls around the mixer.,Irrelevant
The mixing process takes about 12 minutes.,Irrelevant
Three methods are used to ferment the dough.,Irrelevant
In some plants the high speed machinery is designed to manipulate the dough at extreme speeds and with great force which forces the yeast cells to rapidly multiply.,Irrelevant
Fermentation can also be induced by the addition of chemical additives such as 1 cysteine (a naturally occurring amino acid) and vitamin C.,Relevant
Some breads are allowed to ferment naturally.,Irrelevant
In this instance the dough is placed in covered metal bowls and stored in a temperature controlled room until it rises.,Relevant
After the dough has fermented it is loaded into a divider with rotating blades that cut the dough into pre determined weights.,Relevant
A conveyer belt then moves the pieces of dough to a molding machine.,Relevant
The molding machine shapes the dough into balls and drops them onto a layered conveyer belt that is enclosed in a warm humid cabinet called a prover.,Relevant
The dough moves slowly through the prover so that it may rest and so that the gas reproduction may progress.,Relevant
When the dough emerges from the prover it is conveyed to a second molding machine which re shapes the dough into loaves and drops them into pans.,Relevant
The pans travel to another prover that is set at a high temperature and with a high level of humidity.,Relevant
Here the dough regains the elasticity lost during fermentation and the resting period.,Irrelevant
From the prover the pans enter a tunnel oven.,Relevant
The temperature and speed are carefully calculated so that when the loaves emerge from the tunnel they are completely baked and partially cooled.,Irrelevant
While inside the tunnel the loaves are mechanically dumped from the pans onto shelves.,Relevant
The baking and cooling process lasts approximately 30 minutes.,Irrelevant
The bread continues to cool as it moves from the oven to the slicing machine.,Relevant
Here vertical serrated blades move up and down at great speeds slicing the bread into consistently sized pieces.,Relevant
Metal plates hold the slices together while picking up each loaf and passing it to the wrapping machine.,Relevant
Pre printed plastic bags are mechanically slipped over each loaf.,Relevant
At some bakeries workers close the bags with wire twists.,Relevant
Other plants seal the bags with heat.,Relevant
The procedure for manufacturing hard aspirin tablets known as dry granulation or slugging  is as follows.,Irrelevant
The corn starch the active ingredient and the lubricant are weighed separately in sterile canisters to determine if the ingredients meet pre determined specifications for the batch size and dosage amount.,Relevant
The corn starch is dispensed into cold purified water then heated and stirred until a translucent paste forms.,Relevant
The corn starch the active ingredient and part of the lubricant are next poured into one sterile canister and the canister is wheeled to a mixing machine called a Glen Mixer.,Relevant
Mixing blends the ingredients as well as expels air from the mixture.,Relevant
The mixture is then mechanically separated into units which are generally from 7 8 to 1 inches (2.22 to 2.54 centimeters) in size.,Relevant
These units are called slugs.,Irrelevant
Next small batches of slugs are forced through a mesh screen by a hand held stainless steel spatula.,Relevant
Large batches in sizable manufacturing outlets are filtered through a machine called a Fitzpatrick mill.,Relevant
The remaining lubricant is added to the mixture which is blended gently in a rotary granulator and sifter.,Relevant
The lubricant keeps the mixture from sticking to the tablet machine during the compression process.,Irrelevant
The mixture is compressed into tablets either by a single punch machine (for small batches) or a rotary tablet machine (for large scale production).,Relevant
The majority of single punch machines are power driven but hand operated models are still available.,Irrelevant
On single punch machines the mixture is fed into one tablet mold (called a dye cavity) by a feed shoe as follows.,Relevant
The feed shoe passes over the dye cavity and releases the mixture.,Relevant
The feed shoe then retracts and scrapes all excess mixture away from the dye cavity.,Relevant
A punch—a short steel rod—the size of the dye cavity descends into the dye compressing the mixture into a tablet.,Relevant
The punch then retracts while a punch below the dye cavity rises into the cavity and ejects the tablet.,Relevant
As the feed shoe returns to fill the dye cavity again it pushes the compressed tablet from the dye platform.,Relevant
On rotary tablet machines the mixture runs through a feed line into a number of dye cavities which are situated on a large steel plate.,Relevant
The plate revolves as the mixture is dispensed through the feed line rapidly filling each dye cavity.,Relevant
Punches both above and below the dye cavities rotate in sequence with the rotation of the dye cavities.,Relevant
Rollers on top of the upper punches press the punches down onto the dye cavities compressing the mixture into tablets while roller activated punches beneath the dye cavities lift up and eject the tablets from the dye platform.,Relevant
The compressed tablets are subjected to a tablet hardness and friability test as well as a tablet disintegration test (see Quality Control section below).,Relevant
The tablets are transferred to an automated bottling assembly line where they are dispensed into clear or color coated polyethylene or polypropylene plastic bottles or glass bottles.,Relevant
The bottles are topped with cotton packing sealed with a sheer aluminum top and then sealed with a plastic and rubber child proof lid.,Relevant
A sheer round plastic band is then affixed to the circular edge of the lid.,Relevant
It serves as an additional seal to discourage and detect product tampering.,Irrelevant
The bottles are then labeled with product information and an expiration date is affixed.,Relevant
Depending on the manufacturer the bottles are then packaged in individual cardboard boxes.,Relevant
The packages or bottles are then boxed in larger cardboard boxes in preparation for distribution to distributors.,Relevant
The raw materials are carefully weighed in the appropriate amounts and mixed together with a small amount of water to prevent segregation of the ingredients.,Relevant
Cullet (broken waste glass) is also used as a raw material.,Irrelevant
Once the batch is made it is fed to a large tank for melting using the float glass process.,Relevant
First the batch is heated to a molten state and then it is fed into a tank called the float chamber which holds a bath of molten tin.,Relevant
The float chamber is very large—from about 13 feet to 26.25 feet (4 to 8 meters wide and up to almost 197 feet (60 meters) long at its entrance the temperature of the tin is about 1 835 degrees Fahrenheit (1 000 degrees Celsius) while at the exit the tin s temperature is slightly cooler—1 115 degrees Fahrenheit (600 degrees Celsius).,Irrelevant
In the float chamber the glass doesn t submerge into the tin but floats on top of it moving through the tank as though on a conveyor belt.,Relevant
The perfectly flat surface of the tin causes the molten glass also to become flat while the high temperatures clean the glass of impurities.,Irrelevant
The decreased temperature at the exit of the chamber allows the glass to harden enough to move into the next chamber a furnace.,Relevant
After the glass exits from the float chamber rollers pick it up and feed it into a special furnace called a lehr.,Relevant
If any solar coatings are desired they are applied before the glass enters the lehr.,Relevant
In this furnace the glass is cooled gradually to about 395 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius) after the glass exits the lehr it cools to room temperature.,Relevant
It is now very hard and strong and ready to be cut.,Irrelevant
The glass is cut into the desired dimensions using a diamond scribe—a tool with sharp metal points containing diamond dust.,Relevant
Diamond is used because it is harder than glass.,Irrelevant
The scribe marks a cut line into the glass which is then broken or snapped at this line.,Relevant
This step is usually automated and is monitored by cameras and optoelectronic measuring systems.,Irrelevant
Next the cut piece must be bent into shape.,Irrelevant
The sheet of glass is placed into a form or mold of metal or refractory material.,Relevant
The glass filled mold is then heated in a furnace to the point where the glass sags to the shape of the mold.,Relevant
After this shaping step the glass must be hardened in a heating step called tempering.,Irrelevant
The glass is quickly heated to about 1 565 degrees Fahrenheit (850 degrees Celsius) and then it is blasted with jets of cold air.,Relevant
Called quenching this process toughens the glass by putting the outer surface into compression and the inside into tension.,Relevant
This allows the windshield when damaged to break into many small pieces of glass without sharp edges.,Irrelevant
The size of the pieces can also be changed by modifying the tempering procedure so that the windshield breaks into larger pieces allowing good vision until the wind shield can be replaced.,Irrelevant
After the glass is tempered and cleaned it goes through a laminating process.,Relevant
In this process two sheets of glass are bonded together with a layer of plastic (the plastic layer goes inside the two glass sheets).,Relevant
The lamination takes place in an autoclave a special oven that uses both heat and pressure to form a single strong unit that is resistant to tearing.,Relevant
The plastic interlayer is often tinted to act as an ultraviolet filter.,Irrelevant
When laminated glass is broken the broken pieces of glass remain bound to the internal tear resistant plastic layer and the broken sheet remains transparent.,Relevant
Thus visibility remains good.,Irrelevant
Unlike traditional safety glass laminated glass can be further processed—cut drilled and edge worked as necessary.,Irrelevant
A typical laminated windshield is very thin each glass layer is approximately 03 inch (76 millimeter) thick while the plastic interlayer is approximately 098 inch (25 millimeters) thick.,Irrelevant
After laminating the windshield is ready to be assembled with plastic moldings so it can be installed on the car.,Relevant
Known as glass encapsulation this assembly process is usually done at the glass manufacturer.,Irrelevant
First the peripheral section of the windshield is set in a predetermined position in a mold cavity.,Relevant
Next molten plastic is injected into the mold when it cools it forms a plastic frame around the glass.,Relevant
The windshield assembly is then shipped to the car manufacturer where it is installed in an automobile.,Relevant
The installation is done by direct glazing a process that uses a polyurethane adhesive to bond the windshield and automobile body.,Relevant
Soda ash can be manufactured chemically using the Solvay process or it can be made from trona ore.,Irrelevant
If trona ore is used it must first be mined.,Relevant
After it has been brought to the surface the trona ore is transported to a variety of processing plants.,Relevant
There the ore is refined into a slurry of sodium sesquicarbonate an intermediate soda ash product that actually contains both soda ash (sodium carbonate) and baking soda (sodium bicarbonate).,Relevant
Next the intermediate soda ash solution is put into a centrifuge which separates the liquid from the crystals.,Relevant
The crystals are then dissolved in a bicarbonate solution (a soda ash solution made by the manufacturer) in a rotary dissolver thereby becoming a saturated solution.,Relevant
This solution is filtered to remove any non soluble materials and is then pumped through a feed tank to the top of a carbonating tower.,Relevant
Purified carbon dioxide is introduced into the bottom of the tower and held under pressure.,Relevant
As the saturated sodium solution moves through the tower it cools and reacts with the carbon dioxide to form sodium bicarbonate crystals.,Relevant
These crystals are collected at the bottom of the tower and transferred to another centrifuge where excess solution (filtrate) is filtered out.,Relevant
The crystals are then washed in a bicarbonate solution forming a cake like substance ready for drying.,Relevant
The filtrate that is removed from the centrifuge is recycled to the rotary dissolver where it is used to saturate more intermediate soda ash crystals.,Relevant
The washed filter cake is then dried on either a continuous belt conveyor or in a vertical tube drier called a flash dryer.,Relevant
 The theoretical yield from the process according to the Church & Dwight Company is between 90 and 95 percent and the baking soda manufactured is more than 99 percent pure.,Irrelevant
Next the dried crystals of sodium bicarbonate are separated into various grades by particle size.,Relevant
Standard grades of sodium bicarbonate and special grades are manufactured to meet customers specific requirements and particle size is the major determinant of grades.,Irrelevant
Powdered #1 and fine granular #2 have a wide range of uses in foods chemicals and pharmaceuticals.,Irrelevant
Granular grades #4 and #5 are found in foods and doughnuts cleaning compounds pharmaceuticals and many other products.,Irrelevant
Industrial grade sodium bicarbonate is used in diverse applications including oil well drilling fluids fire extinguishing materials and water treatment.,Irrelevant
Each grade goes to a holding bin wherein atmosphere carbon dioxide and moisture content are controlled to cure the product.,Relevant
Once cured the grades are ready to be packaged and shipped.,Relevant
There are four major parts to a standard ball bearing the outer race the rolling balls the inner race and the cage.,Irrelevant
Both races are made in almost the same way.,Irrelevant
Since they are both rings of steel the process starts with steel tubing of an appropriate size.,Relevant
Automatic machines similar to lathes use cutting tools to cut the basic shape of the race leaving all of the dimensions slightly too large.,Relevant
The reason for leaving them too large is that the races must be heat treated before being finished and the steel usually warps during this process.,Irrelevant
They can be machined back to their finished size after heat treating.,Irrelevant
The rough cut races are put into a heat treating furnace at about 1 550 degrees Fahrenheit (843 degrees Celsius) for up to several hours (depending on the size of the parts) then dipped into an oil bath to cool them and make them very hard.,Relevant
This hardening also makes them brittle so the next step is to temper them.,Relevant
This is done by heating them in a second oven to about 300 degrees Fahrenheit (148.8 degrees Celsius) and then letting them cool in air.,Relevant
This whole heat treatment process makes parts which are both hard and tough.,Irrelevant
After the heat treatment process the races are ready for finishing.,Irrelevant
However the races are now too hard to cut with cutting tools so the rest of the work must be done with grinding wheels.,Irrelevant
 These are a lot like what you would find in any shop for sharpening drill bits and tools except that several different kinds and shapes are needed to finish the races.,Irrelevant
Almost every place on the race is finished by grinding which leaves a very smooth accurate surface.,Relevant
The surfaces where the bearing fits into the machine must be very round and the sides must be flat.,Irrelevant
The surface that the balls roll on is ground first and then lapped.,Relevant
This means that a very fine abrasive slurry is used to polish the races for several hours to get almost a mirror finish.,Relevant
At this point the races are finished and ready to be put together with the balls.,Relevant
The balls are a little more difficult to make even though their shape is very simple.,Irrelevant
Surprisingly the balls start out as thick wire.,Relevant
This wire is fed from a roll into a machine that cuts off a short piece and then smashes both ends in toward the middle.,Relevant
This process is called cold heading.,Irrelevant
Its name comes from the fact that the wire is not heated before being smashed and that the original use for the process was to put the heads on nails (which is still how that is done).,Irrelevant
At any rate the balls now look like the planet Saturn with a ring around the middle called flash.,Irrelevant
The first machining process removes this flash.,Relevant
The ball bearings are put between the faces of two cast iron disks where they ride in grooves.,Relevant
The inside of the grooves are rough which tears the flash off of the balls.,Relevant
One wheel rotates while the other one stays still.,Irrelevant
The stationary wheel has holes through it so that the balls can be fed into and taken out of the grooves.,Irrelevant
A special conveyor feeds balls into one hole the balls rattle around the groove and then come out the other hole.,Relevant
They are then fed back into the conveyor for many trips through the wheel grooves until they have been cut down to being fairly round almost to the proper size and the flash is completely gone.,Relevant
Once again the balls are left oversize so that they can be ground to their finished size after heat treatment.,Relevant
The amount of steel left for finishing is not much only about 8 1000 of an inch (02 centimeter) which is about as thick as two sheets of paper.,Irrelevant
The heat treatment process for the balls is similar to that used for the races since the kind of steel is the same and it is best to have all the parts wear at about the same rate.,Irrelevant
Like the races the balls become hard and tough after heat treating and tempering.,Irrelevant
After heat treatment the balls are put back into a machine that works the same way as the flash remover except that the wheels are grinding wheels instead of cutting wheels.,Relevant
These wheels grind the balls down so that they are round and within a few ten thousandths of an inch of their finished size.,Relevant
After this the balls are moved to a lapping machine which has cast iron wheels and uses the same abrasive lapping compound as is used on the races.,Relevant
Here they will be lapped for 8 10 hours depending on how precise a bearing they are being made for.,Relevant
Once again the result is steel that is extremely smooth.,Irrelevant
Steel cages are stamped out of fairly thin sheet metal much like a cookie cutter and then bent to their final shape in a die.,Relevant
A die is made up of two pieces of steel that fit together with a hole the shape of the finished part carved inside.,Irrelevant
When the cage is put in between and the die is closed the cage is bent to the shape of the hole inside.,Relevant
The die is then opened and the finished part is taken out ready to be assembled.,Relevant
Plastic cages are usually made by a process called injection molding.,Irrelevant
In this process a hollow metal mold is filled by squirting melted plastic into it and letting it harden.,Relevant
The mold is opened up and the finished cage is taken out ready for assembly.,Relevant
Now that all of the parts are made the bearing needs to be put together.,Irrelevant
The inner race is put inside the outer race only off to one side as far as possible.,Relevant
This makes a space between them on the opposite side large enough to insert balls between them.,Irrelevant
The required number of balls is put in then the races are moved so that they are both centered and the balls distributed evenly around the bearing.,Relevant
At this point the cage is installed to hold the balls apart from each other.,Relevant
Plastic cages are usually just snapped in while steel cages usually have to be put in and riveted together.,Relevant
Now that the bearing is assembled it is coated with a rust preventative and packaged for shipping.,Relevant
Prior to painting the body must pass through a rigorous inspection process the body in white operation.,Irrelevant
The shell of the vehicle passes through a brightly lit white room where it is fully wiped down by visual inspectors using cloths soaked in hi light oil.,Relevant
Under the lights this oil allows inspectors to see any defects in the sheet metal body panels.,Irrelevant
Dings dents and any other defects are repaired right on the line by skilled body repairmen.,Relevant
After the shell has been fully inspected and repaired the assembly conveyor carries it through a cleaning station where it is immersed and cleaned of all residual oil dirt and contaminants.,Relevant
As the shell exits the cleaning station it goes through a drying booth and then through an undercoat dip—an electrostatically charged bath of undercoat paint (called the E coat) that covers every nook and cranny of the body shell both inside and out with primer.,Relevant
This coat acts as a substrate surface to which the top coat of colored paint adheres.,Irrelevant
After the E coat bath the shell is again dried in a booth as it proceeds on to the final paint operation.,Relevant
In most automobile assembly plants today vehicle bodies are spray painted by robots that have been programmed to apply the exact amounts of paint to just the right areas for just the right length of time.,Irrelevant
Considerable research and programming has gone into the dynamics of robotic painting in order to ensure the fine wet finishes we have come to expect.,Irrelevant
Our robotic painters have come a long way since Ford s first Model Ts which were painted by hand with a brush.,Irrelevant
Once the shell has been fully covered 1 V with a base coat of color paint and a clear top coat the conveyor transfers the bodies through baking ovens where the paint is cured at temperatures exceeding 275 degrees Fahrenheit (135 degrees Celsius).,Relevant
The body and chassis assemblies are mated near the end of the production process.,Relevant
Robotic arms lift the body shell onto the chassis frame where human workers then bolt the two together.,Relevant
After final components are installed the vehicle is driven off the assembly line to a quality checkpoint.,Relevant
The body and chassis assemblies are mated near the end of the production process.,Relevant
Robotic arms lift the body shell onto the chassis frame where human workers then bolt the two together.,Relevant
After final components are installed the vehicle is driven off the assembly line to a quality checkpoint.,Relevant
After the shell leaves the paint area it is ready for interior assembly.,Irrelevant
The painted shell proceeds through the interior assembly area where workers assemble all of the instrumentation and wiring systems dash panels interior lights seats door and trim panels headliners radios speakers all glass except the automobile windshield  steering column and wheel body weatherstrips vinyl tops brake and gas pedals carpeting and front and rear bumper fascias.,Relevant
Next robots equipped with suction cups remove the windshield from a shipping container apply a bead of urethane sealer to the perimeter of the glass and then place it into the body windshield frame.,Relevant
Robots also pick seats and trim panels and transport them to the vehicle for the ease and efficiency of the assembly operator.,Relevant
After passing through this section the shell is given a water test to ensure the proper fit of door panels glass and weatherstripping.,Relevant
It is now ready to mate with the chassis.,Irrelevant
The chassis assembly conveyor and the body shell conveyor meet at this stage of production.,Relevant
As the chassis passes the body conveyor the shell is robotically lifted from its conveyor fixtures and placed onto the car frame.,Relevant
Assembly workers some at ground level and some in work pits beneath the conveyor bolt the car body to the frame.,Relevant
Once the mating takes place the automobile proceeds down the line to receive final trim components battery tires anti freeze and gasoline.,Relevant
The vehicle can now be started.,Irrelevant
From here it is driven to a checkpoint off the line where its engine is audited its lights and horn checked its tires balanced and its charging system examined.,Relevant
Any defects discovered at this stage require that the car be taken to a central repair area usually located near the end of the line.,Relevant
A crew of skilled trouble shooters at this stage analyze and repair all problems.,Relevant
When the vehicle passes final audit it is given a price label and driven to a staging lot where it will await shipment to its destination.,Relevant
Once the component parts of the automobile begin to be assembled at the automotive factory production control specialists can follow the progress of each embryonic automobile by means of its Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) assigned at the start of the production line.,Relevant
In many of the more advanced assembly plants a small radio frequency transponder is attached to the chassis and floor pan.,Irrelevant
This sending unit carries the VIN information and monitors its progress along the assembly process.,Relevant
Knowing what operations the vehicle has been through where it is going and when it should arrive at the next assembly station gives production management personnel the ability to electronically control the manufacturing sequence.,Relevant
Throughout the assembly process quality audit stations keep track of vital information concerning the integrity of various functional components of the vehicle.,Relevant
Here is the life of how an automobile is manufactured.,Irrelevant
Step 1 The metal is delivered to the manufacturing plant and placed on an assembly line.,Relevant
Here it is pressed and ironed by heat to the correct thickness for the needed part.,Relevant
It is then stamped into the correct auto part door fenders roofs and hoods.,Relevant
This process is more precise because of the use of the robotic arms that measure each piece.,Irrelevant
The components are then stockpiled in a central location to be used on the different types of automobiles in the manufacturer’s line of automobiles.,Relevant
Step 2 Now comes the welding process.,Irrelevant
Each piece is fitted into place and welded using high heat.,Relevant
This part of the process is handled mostly by robots.,Irrelevant
After each piece is welded into place it is inspected to ensure that it meets all expectations.,Relevant
This is one of the hardest parts of the process because it involves not only the robot being programmed correctly but also depends on the inspector’s understanding when a piece “just doesn’t fit right.,Irrelevant
” Step 3 The next part is the one that gives it a clean shiny glow.,Irrelevant
The body of the car gets a nice warm shower to wash away the dirt and grime of the assembly process.,Relevant
Then the car is whisked off to the painting line.,Relevant
It is painted 4 times the primer is first.,Relevant
The car passes through a pool of paint that has electricity running through it.,Relevant
This prevents rusting.,Irrelevant
Stage 2 is the surface where grey paint is sprayed on so that the topcoat will have the same color throughout.,Irrelevant
Top coat is then sprayed onto every surface.,Relevant
The color is chosen by the customer.,Relevant
The last step in this process is the clear coat where the car gets its shiny finish.,Relevant
Step 4 Now the get up and go is added.,Irrelevant
The engine which is made up of forged parts of metal as well as the casted material is assembled into the engine compartment.,Relevant
More than 500 parts of metal are used to make the engine and the suspension.,Irrelevant
We now travel further down the assembly line.,Irrelevant
Step 5 The parts from the suppliers of the nuts and bolts being arriving.,Irrelevant
The suppliers only ship parts for the automobiles that are being produced.,Relevant
This saves space with unneeded parts hanging around.,Irrelevant
Each car manufacturer has their own procedure with procuring the supplies.,Irrelevant
Step 6 Assembly is next where the body moves on a conveyor line and the parts are placed according to a certain set of instructions.,Relevant
If a problem is found the belt stops and the problem is solved.,Relevant
This is an example of man and machine working together.,Irrelevant
Step 7 Inspections are then performed and if the car passes all inspections then it is shipped to the car dealership and then the customer.,Relevant
First the leads are created by mixing graphite powder and clay which is then baked.,Relevant
Next pencil bodies need to be made.,Relevant
If wooden the right material needs to be selected to resist some pressure without breaking and be soft enough to sharpen.,Relevant
Staedtler in Germany use cedarwood from California.,Irrelevant
Precut sections are delivered to the factory.,Relevant
These have grooves cut into them to receive the pencil leads and special glue is added to stick the leads in place.,Relevant
Next every second piece is sent to a separate conveyor.,Relevant
The leads are added to the first and the second wooden slats are glued to the first ones to form a multi pencil sandwich.,Relevant
These are then compressed to let the glue cure.,Relevant
Now the pencil sandwiches are cut lengthways and shaped to form individual unsharpened pencils which later have the points sharpened.,Relevant
The final phase generally involves lacquering the wood to hide the grain adding branding and other markers for identification of the type.,Relevant
The milky latex is actually the tree s sap and incredibly useful it is.,Irrelevant
Firstly molds or formers are cleaned and prepared.,Relevant
To be honest this phase looks a little creepy you ll see what we mean in this video.,Irrelevant
Latex gloves are actually not 100% pure.,Irrelevant
Additives are added to improve the elasticity and shelf life of the latex.,Relevant
The cleaned formers or molds are dipped into the latex concoction at a specified time depending on the desired glove thickness.,Relevant
Once coated the formers plus latex covering are heated or vulcanized to prevent cracking whilst drying.,Relevant
Gloves are then leached to remove excess latex to minimize the chance of users having an allergic reaction.,Relevant
After this process the gloves are beaded for ease of donning.,Relevant
The gloves may then be powdered sometimes using cornstarch or chlorinated to reduce their tackiness.,Relevant
Workers then remove the gloves from the formers by hand ready for quality checking packaging and shipping.,Relevant
Obviously the tomato paste is the main ingredient.,Irrelevant
The paste is pumped into a holding tank ready for use.,Relevant
Depending on the batch size measured volumes of paste are passed into a cooking kettle where it is heated and constantly stirred.,Relevant
The other ingredients are then added in a correct proportion to the batch size.,Relevant
The mixture is constantly stirred.,Relevant
Before bottling the ketchup needs to pass through a series of gradual cooling stages.,Relevant
At the same time bottles are prepared and aligned ready for receiving the ketchup.,Relevant
These bottles are then filled with ketchup usually using an automated system caps are added and labels are attached.,Relevant
The bottles of ketchup are now ready for packaging on distribution.,Relevant
Our next example of industrial processes is another interesting one.,Irrelevant
 Mineral wool has a massive variety of applications across many industries.,Irrelevant
The process starts by taking big chunks of slag and rock melting them down and then spinning the melt into threads of mineral wool.,Relevant
We are sold already.,Irrelevant
The slag and rock tend to be sourced from the steel industry.,Irrelevant
Coke is used to fuel the entire process.,Relevant
The rock and slag are first partially crushed and then loaded into a cupola in alternating layers with coke.,Relevant
As the coke is ignited and burned the mineral is heated to the molten state at a temperature of 1300 to 1650°C (2400 to 3000°F).,Relevant
The molten rock then exits the bottom of the cupola into a fiberizing device which uses one of two processes.,Relevant
The Powell process uses groups of rotors revolving at high speed.,Irrelevant
The molten material is distributed in a thin film on the surfaces of the rotors and then is thrown off by centrifugal force causing long fibrous tails to form.,Relevant
Air or steam is blown around the rotors to assist in fiberizing the material.,Relevant
A second method the Downey process uses a spinning concave rotor and air or steam to help with fiberizing.,Irrelevant
The process is similar to that used when making cotton candy or candy floss for those in the UK.,Irrelevant
Later a binder is added and a large pendulum device is used to deposit the wool in zig zagged sheets the number of layers of which will vary depending on final requirements.,Relevant
This loosely packed mat is then passed through rollers to compress it and form more uniform sheets.,Relevant
Additional heat is usually applied to cure the binder.,Relevant
The sheets then pass through more rollers to compress it further which are then trimmed and cut to form the final product.,Relevant
Pretty neat and very cool to watch.,Irrelevant
Molten polycarbonate plastic is used to make the actual disk.,Irrelevant
Digital information if used is then stamped onto it while the disk is still near the melting point.,Relevant
Often this involves a die and the stamp creates microscopic bumps called pits and lands .,Relevant
These provide the binary coding for the data to be read .,Irrelevant
Once complete the reflective foil layer is applied using a process called sputtering or wet silvering.,Relevant
This allows the reader s laser to reflect the light back to the player.,Relevant
This is usually made of aluminum but can also include precious metals such as silver gold or platinum.,Irrelevant
To finish a lacquer coating is applied to seal the reflective layer and prevent oxidation.,Relevant
Ice cream sandwiches are very satisfying to eat and also to watch being made.,Irrelevant
Honestly you won t be disappointed.,Irrelevant
The process is pretty simple but the engineering behind the machines less so.,Irrelevant
Ice cream is first whipped to add air.,Relevant
This is fed into the next part of the assembly.,Relevant
Here two sets of wafers are sandwiched together as the ice cream is simultaneously injected between them.,Relevant
 They are then packaged refrigerated obviously and shipped out for you all to enjoy.,Relevant
Giant specialized mixers are used to mix these ingredients under high temperatures and pressures.,Relevant
Recipes will vary slightly from each part of the tire but the final result at this stage is thin rubber gum.,Irrelevant
These are rolled into sheets.,Relevant
Then the task of assembling the tire on a tire building machine begins.,Relevant
Different combinations of cloth metal and rubber from each component of the tire skeleton walls and treads etc are combined together to form the final product.,Relevant
The last step is to cure the tire.,Relevant
The “green” tire is heated at more than 300 degrees Fahrenheit for twelve to fifteen minutes vulcanizing it to bond the components and to cure the rubber.,Relevant
Dart manufacture is a proper example of some old school industrial processes.,Irrelevant
The flight shafts are made first.,Relevant
 3 meter aluminum rods are loaded into a machine that has several cutting tools.,Relevant
These tools work from many angles simultaneously on each rod.,Irrelevant
The rod is made into several shafts with threads cut so they can be attached to the final dart barrel.,Irrelevant
A cross saw cuts the slot for the arrow flights on the other end.,Relevant
The entire process is carried out with a liberal amount of oil to carry away the metal shavings and keep the cutting tools cool.,Relevant
Brass rods are loaded into a similar machine to make the dart barrels.,Relevant
These are then tooled and fashioned into the barrels the bit you hold.,Relevant
One end is threaded and tapered so the shaft can be attached as well as to make the arrow aerodynamic.,Relevant
Grooves are also cut into the barrels surface to make the arrow easy and comfortable to hold.,Relevant
Barrels can also be made of tungsten these allow for narrower parts to be created.,Relevant
Professional players actually prefer tungsten darts FYI.,Irrelevant
The final step is to create a dart point.,Relevant
This is achieved by forcing pointed steel into the hollow part of the barrel using a hydraulic press.,Relevant
Dart segments are then assembled and the flights attached to create one perfectly crafted dart.,Relevant
The process behind making potato chips (crisps if you re British) is also pretty interesting.,Irrelevant
To start off with having a batch of potatoes is obviously handy.,Relevant
These are delivered to the factory in large quantities.,Relevant
Each and everyone is checked for quality and taste.,Relevant
Some are punched with holes to allow tracking through the cooking process.,Relevant
Defective potatoes are kept to one side for instance if they have green edges or blemishes.,Relevant
If their weight exceeds the factory s preset allowances the entire shipment can be sent back to the supplier.,Relevant
Acceptable potatoes are then fed via conveyor belts into a vertical helical conveyor.,Relevant
This removes dirt and stones if any and the potatoes are then passed on to an automatic peeler.,Relevant
The peeled potatoes are then passed through a revolving impaler presser that cuts them into uniform paper thin slices.,Relevant
The blades can be either straight or ridged depending on the product.,Relevant
Excess starch can be removed in a cold soak.,Relevant
Color treatment is also added at this stage if required.,Relevant
The paper thin potato slices now pass on to the important bit frying and salting.,Relevant
They first pass under air jets to remove excess water.,Relevant
The slices are then passed through very hot oil (between 176 and 190 degrees centigrade).,Relevant
They are gently passed along with paddles.,Relevant
As they complete their trip through the oil salt is added at a predetermined concentration.,Relevant
Flavoring is also added if needed.,Relevant
Potato chips are then drained of excess oil cooled and sorted and burned ones are removed automatically using optical sorters before packaging.,Relevant
The process starts by melting recycled glass as well as previously rejected marble stocks (e.g. marbles that were too big or too small).,Relevant
All of these random assortments of glass are fed into a kiln for melting.,Relevant
 16 hours later or so the molten glass is drained from the kiln and is ready for processing.,Relevant
A cutter bar cuts the stream of molten glass every half a second to make little pieces of glass called slugs.,Relevant
These will eventually become marbles.,Irrelevant
Marble sizes are determined by altering the time intervals of the shearing action quicker for smaller marbles slower for large ones.,Irrelevant
The still hot slugs then pass through a series of constantly rotating metal ridged rollers that keep the slugs separated while cooling them and giving them their signature spherical shape.,Relevant
The marble s final appearance or coloring was determined in the kiln as air passed coloring through the molten glass.,Irrelevant
Solidified marbles are then sorted by size.,Relevant
Firstly the metal jacket for the bullet is formed from stretching copper cups to receive the lead core at a later stage.,Relevant
Hornady prefers to use mechanical force to achieve this rather than heating and molding.,Irrelevant
This takes several stages to gradually stretch the copper to its desired length and diameter.,Irrelevant
A lead core is later added inside the jacket.,Relevant
Further stages of mechanical force are used to slowly form the characteristic bullet shape.,Relevant
This reshaping leads to excess lead being forced out of the top of the bullet.,Relevant
These are trimmed off.,Relevant
Further forced reshaping occurs and once again excess lead is trimmed off the nose until the complete finalized bullet shape is achieved.,Relevant
Excess lead is shaped to form the bullet tip.,Relevant

The following description of the manufacturing process is for driver side air bag module assembly.,Irrelevant
Passenger side air bag module assemblies are produced slightly differently.,Irrelevant
The propellant consists of sodium azide mixed together with an oxidizer a substance that helps the sodium azide to burn when ignited.,Irrelevant
The sodium azide is received from outside vendors and inspected to make sure it conforms to requirements.,Relevant
After inspection it is placed in a safe storage place until needed.,Relevant
At the same time the oxidizer is received from outside vendors inspected and stored.,Relevant
Different manufacturers use different oxidizers.,Irrelevant
From storage the sodium azide and the oxidizer are then carefully blended under sophisticated computerized process control.,Relevant
Because of the possibility of explosions the powder processing takes place in isolated bunkers.,Relevant
If the event safety sensors detect a spark high speed deluge systems will douse whole rooms with water.,Relevant
Production occurs in several redundant smaller facilities so that if an accident does occur production will not be shut down only decreased.,Irrelevant
After blending the propellant mixture is sent to storage.,Relevant
Presses are then used to compress the propellant mixture into disk or pellet form.,Relevant
The inflator components such as the metal canister the filter assembly—stainless steel wire mesh with ceramic material inside—and initiator (or igniter) are received from outside vendors and inspected.,Relevant
The components are then assembled on a highly automated production line.,Relevant
The inflator sub assembly is combined with the propellant and an initiator to form the inflator assembly.,Relevant
Laser welding (using CO 2 gas) is used to join stainless steel inflator sub assemblies while friction inertial welding is used to join aluminum inflator sub assemblies.,Relevant
Laser welding entails using laser beams to weld the assemblies together while friction inertial welding involves rubbing two metals together until the surfaces become hot enough to join together.,Relevant
The inflator assembly is then tested and sent to storage until needed.,Relevant
The woven nylon air bag fabric is received from outside vendors and inspected for any material defects.,Relevant
The air bag fabric is then die cut to the proper shapes and sewn internally and externally to properly join the two sides.,Relevant
After the air bag is sewn it is inflated and checked for any seam imperfections.,Relevant
The air bag assembly is then mounted to the tested inflator assembly.,Relevant
Next the air bag is folded and the breakaway plastic horn pad cover is installed.,Relevant
Finally the completed module assembly is inspected and tested.,Relevant
The module assemblies are packaged in boxes for shipment and then sent to customers.,Relevant
The remaining components of the air bag system—the crash sensors the diagnostic monitoring unit the steering wheel connecting coil and the indicator lamp—are combined with the air bag module during vehicle assembly.,Relevant
All the components are connected and communicate through a wiring harness.,Relevant
Early in the process sometimes even before the leather is cut the lettering—usually foil tape—identifying the manufacturer is burned into the leather with a brass stamping die.,Relevant
The shell of the glove is sewn together while inside out.,Relevant
It is then turned right side out and its lining is inserted.,Relevant
Before being reversed the shell is mulled (wetted or  steamed for flexibility) so that it doesn t crack or rip when it is turned.,Relevant
The turned shell is put on a device known as a hot hand which is a hand shaped metallic form its heat helps the shell form to its correct size.,Relevant
At this point the hot hand also assures that all the openings for the fingers (finger stalls) are open correctly.,Relevant
A pad is inserted into the heel of a glove.,Relevant
Better gloves have two part pads that make it easier for the glove to flex in the correct direction when squeezed.,Irrelevant
The padding in a glove is made of two layers of leather hand stitched together.,Irrelevant
Catchers mitts which need a thicker palm than other gloves are made with five layers of leather padding.,Irrelevant
At this same point plastic reinforcements are inserted at the thumb and toe (little finger) sections of the glove.,Relevant
These devices provide added support for the glove and protect the player s fingers from being bent backwards accidentally.,Irrelevant
Before all the parts of the glove are laced together the web is fabricated out of several pieces of leather.,Relevant
The web can consist of anywhere from two to six pieces of leather depending on the type of web desired.,Irrelevant
The lacing around the edges of a glove is usually one piece of rawhide that might be as much as 80 90 inches (203 228 centimeters) long.,Irrelevant
The lacing begins at the thumb or little finger and holds the entire glove together.,Irrelevant
The final lacing operation is at the web section.,Relevant
Some non leather stitching is needed for the individual parts—the web for instance is usually stitched together with nylon thread.,Relevant
The strap across the back of the hand of a glove used to be lined with shearling (sheepskin) a synthetic material is now used.,Relevant
Catchers mitts and first base gloves 1 O are hand assembled and sewn from four parts—palm pad back and web.,Relevant
The palm and back are sewn together first and then joined together with the other pieces with rawhide lacing.,Relevant
The final step is called a lay off operation the glove is again placed on a hot hand to adjust any shaping problems and to make sure that the openings for the fingers (finger stalls) have remained open throughout the manufacturing process.,Relevant
In an alkaline battery the cathode actually doubles as part of the container.,Irrelevant
Huge loads of the constituent ingredients—manganese dioxide carbon black (graphite) and an electrolyte (potassium hydroxide in solution)—are delivered by train and mixed in very large batches at the production site.,Relevant
The mixture is then granulated and pressed or compacted into hollow cylinders called preforms.,Relevant
 Depending on the size of the battery being made several preforms may be stacked one on top of another in a battery.,Irrelevant
Alternatively the series of preforms can be replaced by an extruded ring of the same material.,Irrelevant
The preforms are next inserted into a nickel plated steel can the combination of the preforms and the steel can make up the cathode of the battery.,Relevant
In a large operation the cans are made at the battery factory using standard cutting and forming techniques.,Irrelevant
An indentation is made near the top of the can and an asphalt or epoxy sealant is placed above the indentation to protect against leakage.,Relevant
A paper separator soaked in the electrolyte solution is then inserted inside the can against the preforms the separator is made from several pieces of paper laid at crossgrains to each other (like plywood).,Relevant
Looking down at an open can one would see what looks like a paper cup inserted into the can.,Irrelevant
The separator keeps the cathode material from coming into contact with the anode material.,Irrelevant
As an alternative a manufacturer might use a porous synthetic fiber for the same purpose.,Irrelevant
The anode goes into the battery can next.,Relevant
It is a gel composed primarily of zinc powder along with other materials including a potassium hydroxide electrolyte.,Irrelevant
This gel has the consistency of a very thick paste.,Irrelevant
Rather than a solution it is chemically a suspension in which particles do not settle (though an appropriate filter could separate them).,Irrelevant
The gel does not fill the can to the top so as to allow space for the chemical reactions that will occur once the battery is put into use.,Irrelevant
Though the battery is able to produce electricity at this point an open cell is not practical and would exhaust its potential rapidly.,Irrelevant
The battery needs to be sealed with three connected components.,Relevant
The first a brass nail or long spike is inserted into the middle of the can through the gel material and serves as a current collector.,Relevant
The second is a plastic seal and the third a metal end cap.,Relevant
The nail which extends about two thirds of the way into the can is welded to the metal end cap and then passed through the plastic seal.,Relevant
This seal is significantly thinner in some places than in others so that if too much gas builds up in the can the seal will rupture rather than the entire battery.,Irrelevant
Some battery designs make use of a wax filled hole in the plastic excess gas pushes through the wax rather than rupturing the battery.,Irrelevant
The seal assembly meets the indentation made in the can at the beginning of the process and is crimped in place.,Relevant
The opposite end of the can (the positive end of the battery) is then closed with a steel plate that is either welded in place or glued with an epoxy type cement.,Relevant
Before the battery leaves the factory a label is added identifying the type of battery its size and other information.,Relevant
The label is often paper that is simply glued to the battery.,Irrelevant
One large manufacturer has its label design printed on plastic shrink wrap a loose fitting piece of heat sensitive plastic is wrapped around the battery can and then exposed to a blast of heat that makes the plastic shrink down to fit tightly around the can.,Irrelevant
Although more clothing manufacturers are making and distributing bicycle shorts for general sport and even nonathletic use this section will describe how the short designed for the professional cyclist is manufactured.,Irrelevant
First the fabric (usually a blend of polyester cotton spandex and nylon) must be manufactured.,Relevant
This involves spinning and combining the various threads into a single fabric washing and drying the fabric and then dyeing it.,Relevant
Next it is saturated or sprayed with a water resistant finish before being cut into panels according to pattern specifications set by the designer.,Relevant
The various panels are then carefully sewn together.,Relevant
To avoid raised ridges seams may be offset for a smoother finish.,Relevant
Finally elastic is inserted in the waistband of the sewn short.,Relevant
Gripper elastic bands are also sewn into the cuffs at the short s hem.,Relevant
The chamois liner s layers are cut out according to pattern specifications before being bonded or laminated together.,Relevant
After assembly they are stitched along the outer edges to prevent fraying.,Relevant
Sometimes a special thread similar to a soft floss is used to prevent chafing.,Relevant
The finished product will have a molded look.,Irrelevant
It is usually inserted inside the bicycle short with a strip of tape to hold it in place.,Relevant
Several manufacturers have developed a one piece chamois that does not require any seams and avoids any overlapping of material.,Irrelevant
The completed bicycle short is tested for defects.,Relevant
After passing inspection it is ready to be packaged and shipped to a retailer.,Relevant
The bulb can be made using various processes but it is most commonly produced using vacuum assisted injection molding.,Irrelevant
Compressed air is used to blow the melted rubber or neoprene material into the cavity of a two piece metal die set featuring the negative image of the bulb (the operation resembles blowing a gum bubble inside a bottle).,Relevant
The die also contains small holes through which air is drawn out just before the material is injected helping it flow into the die cavity at a uniform thickness.,Relevant
While these holes are large enough to allow air to escape they are too small to permit significant amounts of the rubber to seep out.,Irrelevant
The remnant of the rubber material that is drawn into the holes produces small protuberances that resemble the small whiskers visible on a new tire.,Relevant
Within a few seconds of its injection the material has cooled so that the die may be opened revealing the finished bulb.,Relevant
After a minimal amount of hand work to remove the whiskers the bulb is ready to be attached to the other components.,Relevant
The valves are made by die casting plastic injection molding and machining from bar material.,Irrelevant
They incorporate connection features that allow the bulb and hose to be attached.,Relevant
Machined valves can be made on a lathe controlled by a computer program that instructs it to turn the shape threads and other features.,Irrelevant
The gauge consists of further sub assemblies each of which contains machined molded and stamped parts.,Relevant
The most important component of the gauge is the pressure element.,Irrelevant
It is constructed by soldering two disks together at the formed lip to construct a hollow wafer.,Irrelevant
The pressure from the system is introduced into the wafer though a hole in the socket connection which in turn is connected to the squeeze bulb and cuff.,Relevant
As the internal pressure increases the wafer swells.,Irrelevant
It is this swelling that is detected by the movement assembly causing the pointer to rotate about the dial.,Irrelevant
After assembly the gauge must be calibrated.,Relevant
This is accomplished by connecting it to a pressure source with a master gauge of known accuracy.,Relevant
Slight adjustments are made in the movement linkage until the pointer of the gauge reflects the correct pressure readings.,Relevant
The constricting cuff or bladder is made by heat sealing two rubber sheets together to form a flexible band.,Relevant
A tubing fitting is incorporated into this sealing process providing a connection for the air supply.,Relevant
A fabric covering is then sewn to the bladder by conventional methods.,Relevant
The hoses are made by continuous extrusion a process in which pellets of rubber or similar material are heated to the melting point at which they become clay like and viscous.,Relevant
Within the same machine a rotating screw device forces this molten material through a die block which is simply a hole in an aluminum block the same size as the outside of the tubing.,Relevant
Secured within the block is a rod that is the same size as the inside of the tubing and positioned in the center of the hole.,Irrelevant
As the material flows around the rod and out the hole it cools and assumes the shape of the tubing.,Relevant
At this point it is cut to length and coiled onto spools for shipment to the assembly facility.,Relevant
At final assembly hoses are used to connect the components discussed above.,Relevant
The hoses are then checked for leaks and the calibration is verified.,Relevant
This is a good example of JIT (just in time) material requirements planning and TQC (total quality concept) management.,Irrelevant
Missing any one of the components the entire assembly is useless.,Irrelevant
The plant must receive the parts and supplies in a timely manner to assure delivery of the finished product to the customer.,Irrelevant
The items must be of satisfactory quality so they can be assembled correctly and without compromising the design.,Irrelevant
Many companies today have established quality management procedures.,Irrelevant
These procedures are simply intensive studies of all aspects of manufacture to eliminate or reduce the possibility of producing a defective part.,Irrelevant
Denim unlike many types of cloth (which are woven in one place and sent to another for dying) is woven and dyed at one location.,Irrelevant
There are several steps between ginned cotton (cotton after it has been picked from fields and processed) and cotton yarn.,Irrelevant
The incoming cotton is removed from tightly packed bales and inspected before undergoing a process known as carding.,Relevant
 In this process the cotton is put through machines that contain brushes with bent wire teeth.,Relevant
These brushes—called cards —clean disentangle straighten and gather together the  cotton fibers.,Relevant
At this point the fibers are called slivers.,Irrelevant
Other machines join several slivers together and these slivers are then pulled and twisted which serves to make the threads stronger.,Relevant
Next these ropes are put on spinning machines that further twist and stretch the fibers to form yarn.,Relevant
Some cloths are woven (see step 5 below) and then dyed but denim is usually dyed with chemically synthesized indigo before being woven.,Relevant
Large balls of yarn called ball warps are dipped in the indigo mixture several times so that the dye covers the yarn in layers.,Relevant
(These many layers of indigo dye explain why blue jeans fade slightly with each washing).,Irrelevant
Although the exact chemicals used in such dyeing procedures remain trade secrets it is known that a small amount of sulfur is often used to stabilize the top or bottom layers of indigo dye.,Relevant
The dyed yarn is then slashed  that is it is coated with sizing (any one of a variety of starchy substances) to make the threads stronger and stiffer.,Relevant
Once this operation is complete the yarn threads are ready to woven with undyed filling yarn threads.,Relevant
The yarn is then woven on large mechanical looms.,Relevant
Denim is not 100 percent blue as the blue dyed threads forming the warp (long vertical threads) are combined with white threads forming the weft (shorter horizontal  threads).,Relevant
Because denim is woven with the blue threads packed closer together than the white threads and with the blue threads covering three out of four white threads the blue threads dominate.,Irrelevant
(By examining a piece of denim closely one can detect the steep diagonal pattern that results from this process which is known as a three by one right hand twill weave).,Irrelevant
Although mechanized looms make use of the same basic weaving procedure as a simple hand loom they are much larger and faster.,Irrelevant
A modern shuttle less loom (which uses a very small carrier instead of the traditional shuttle to weave the weft threads between the warp threads) may produce as much as 3 279 yards (3 000 meters) of cloth 3.28 or 4.37 yards (three or four meters) wide in a single week.,Irrelevant
As much as 1 093 yards (1 000 meters) of cloth may be rolled into a single huge bolt.,Irrelevant
At this point the denim is ready for finishing a term referring to a variety of treatments applied to cloth after it is woven.,Relevant
With denim finishing is usually fairly simple.,Irrelevant
The cloth is brushed to remove loose threads and lint and the denim is usually skewed in a way that will prevent it from twisting when it is made into clothing.,Relevant
The denim may then be sanforized  or preshrunk.,Relevant
Preshrunk denim should shrink no more than three percent after three washings.,Irrelevant
Once the desired design is selected patterns from the design are cut from heavy paper or cardboard.,Relevant
Up to 80 different sizes are possible from one pattern.,Irrelevant
The pieces of denim are then cut with high speed cutting machines from stacks 100 layers thick.,Relevant
Excluding rivets buttons and zippers a pair of blue jeans contains about ten different pieces from the pockets to the leg panels to the waistband and belt loops.,Irrelevant
The pieces of denim are ready to be sewn at this point.,Relevant
Sewing is done in an assembly line fashion with rows of industrial human operated sewing machines.,Relevant
Each sewer is assigned a specific function such as making only back pockets.,Irrelevant
First the various pockets and belt loops are assembled.,Relevant
Next one sewer attaches the pockets to the leg seams another then sews the leg seams together and still another attaches the waist band.,Relevant
Once the waist band is secure the belt loops may be stitched on and the buttons attached.,Relevant
If the jeans include a zipper it is then sewn into place and the pants are hemmed.,Relevant
Finally the rivets are placed in the appropriate places and the maker s label is sewn on last.,Relevant
Some jeans are prewashed and or stone washed to alter the appearance or texture of the finished jeans.,Relevant
Prewashing involves washing the jeans in industrial detergent for a short time to soften the denim.,Irrelevant
Stone washing also means washing the jeans but pumice is added to the load resulting in a faded appearance.,Irrelevant
Small stones (less than one inch [one centimeter] in diameter) produce an even abrasion while large stones (about four inches [10 centimeters] in diameter) highlight the seams and pockets and produce a more uneven appearance.,Irrelevant
The completed pair of blue jeans is I 0 then pressed.,Relevant
They are placed into a large pressing machine that steam irons the entire garment at once in about a minute.,Relevant
A size tag is punched into the material and the jeans are folded stacked and placed in boxes according to style color and size before being sent to the warehouse for storage.,Relevant
When the jeans are selected to be sent to a store they are put in large shipping cartons and sent on freight trains or trucks.,Relevant
After the book is written and appropriate design elements are agreed upon book production can begin.,Relevant
The first stage is type setting in which the actual text is converted into the appropriate typeface style (known as font) and size (known as point size).,Relevant
 After the typeset version of the book has been reviewed and any necessary changes made it is ready for printing and binding in which the actual pages are printed and bound together with the cover resulting in a finished book.,Relevant
The typesetting and printing— printing consists of filming and all subsequent steps—are typically done not by the publisher but by specialized vendors.,Relevant
First the manuscript is converted into the desired font and point size.,Relevant
If the manuscript has not been completed on a computer it must be typed into a computer by the type setter.,Relevant
If it is already in electronic form however the typesetter simply has to make programming changes to convert the manuscript into the proper style.,Relevant
The result is generally (but not always see step #3 below) a galley of the text.,Irrelevant
A galley form of manuscript consists of long pages of text in a single column.,Irrelevant
The galley includes the proper typeface but the proper pagination still must be worked out.,Irrelevant
Galleys are then proofread and edited for errors by the publisher.,Relevant
This stage is particularly important if the manuscript has been typeset (typed) from a hard copy of the text.,Irrelevant
If the manuscript was typeset from a computer disk most of the errors should have already been corrected during a review of the manuscript.,Irrelevant
The single column format of galleys facilitates the proofreading.,Irrelevant
After galleys are thoroughly proofed and edited pages (or lasers) are produced.,Relevant
An exact layout of typeset pages but usually printed on standard typing paper pages are also reviewed for accuracy by the publisher.,Relevant
Some books skip the galley stage and proceed directly to pages.,Relevant
Once any necessary changes have been made the typesetter then produces a mechanical of the typeset pages.,Relevant
Also called camera copy the mechanical is printed on high quality paper that is suitable for filming the first stage in the printing process.,Irrelevant
The work of the typesetting vendor—if different from the publisher—is now done.,Irrelevant
The typeset mechanical now goes to the printing and binding vendor.,Relevant
First each text page including line drawings is photographed (or shot) using a large camera to produce page negatives.,Relevant
These negatives are the opposite of what will actually print.,Irrelevant
In other words the text and photos will appear backward in negative form.,Irrelevant
Negatives are then checked to make sure there are no blemishes present.,Relevant
While printed words and line drawings are all one shade of black photographs have many shades from palest gray to deepest black and must be filmed using a special process to maintain these shades.,Irrelevant
The process converts the shades into black and white dots—very light areas have many dots while darker areas have fewer dots.,Relevant
The converted photographs are known as halftones.,Irrelevant
 If the book will have more than one color of ink a separate negative for each color is made.,Relevant
For color photos for instance four negatives are generally used cyan magenta yellow and black.,Irrelevant
For this reason books with color will have negative overlays (one negative overlay for each color).,Irrelevant
Because of the added overlays a book printed in more than one color involves additional preparation and cost.,Irrelevant
The negatives are then taped or stripped into their proper place onto a large sheet called a goldenrod or a flat.,Relevant
 Each flat holds 32 or 64 pages and enough flats are used to equal the number of pages in the book.,Irrelevant
Strippers examine each finished flat on a lineup table to ensure that text and illustrations are properly lined up and in sequence.,Relevant
(The book pages are not lined up in consecutive order on the flat and in fact some of the pages are placed upside down.,Relevant
Such placing is necessary because the finished paper version of each flat will be folded several times once the flat is folded the 32 or 64 pages will be in the proper order.,Irrelevant
This placement method is known as imposition.,Irrelevant
To make this examination process easier the lineup tables are equipped with a fluorescent light that shines up through the negatives so it is easier for the stripper to read and align the text.,Irrelevant
To make sure the book is progressing properly a proof of each flat is made by shining ultraviolet light through the negatives to expose their images onto a special light sensitive paper.,Relevant
The resulting pages are called blueprints (or silverprints bluelines or dyluxes) because the paper and ink are blue or silver in appearance.,Irrelevant
The blueprints are then checked carefully by the publisher.,Relevant
If an editor or art director finds an error on a blueprint or decides to make a change the page in question has to be rephotographed.,Relevant
The new negative will then be stripped onto the flat.,Relevant
7 After final approval each flat is photographed with the negatives being exposed onto (or burned onto) a thin sheet of aluminum called a plate.,Relevant
 The sections of the plates that contain text and illustrations are then treated with a chemical that attracts ink thereby ensuring that the text and illustrations will print when on press.,Relevant
The plates are then sent to press.,Relevant
If printing in only one color each plate will require only one pass through the press.,Relevant
If printing more than one color an additional pass will be required for each color.,Relevant
For example if two colors are used the paper is fed through the press twice.,Irrelevant
There are three main printing processes used in book production  offset lithography letter press  and gravure.,Irrelevant
 The process used depends less on quality differences than on economic factors such as availability of  machines number of books being printed (the print run) and the speed of delivery.,Irrelevant
Presses are either sheet fed (single sheets of paper are fed through) or web fed (huge rolls of paper are unwound and run through).,Relevant
After the sheets are printed and dry they are delivered to the bindery.,Relevant
While many large printing companies have their own binderies other smaller printers must send the printed sheets to a outside bindery.,Irrelevant
At the bindery the flats are folded and collated into book signatures —properly folded 32 or 64 page sections—that are then bound in proper sequence.,Relevant
All of these functions are automated.,Irrelevant
Book binding also involves sewing the signatures together gluing the spine and inserting lining and trimming the edges.,Relevant
The amount and type of binding depends on the type of book (paperback or hardback) and its size.,Irrelevant
In the final step the book is cased in or enclosed in a cover.,Relevant
The initial step in producing brick is crushing and grinding the raw materials in a separator and a jaw crusher.,Relevant
Next the blend of ingredients desired for each particular batch is selected and filtered before being sent on to one of three brick shaping processes—extrusion molding or pressing the first of which is the most adaptable and thus the most common.,Relevant
Once the bricks are formed and any subsequent procedures performed they are dried to remove excess moisture that might otherwise cause cracking during the ensuing firing process.,Relevant
Next they are fired in ovens and then cooled.,Relevant
Finally they are dehacked—automatically stacked wrapped with steel bands and padded with plastic corner protectors.,Relevant
First each of the ingredients is conveyed to a separator that removes oversize material.,Relevant
A jaw crusher with horizontal steel plates then squeezes the particles rendering them still smaller.,Relevant
After the raw materials for each batch of bricks have been selected a scalping screen is often used to separate the different sizes of material.,Relevant
Material of the correct size is sent to storage silos and over sized material goes to a hammermill which pulverizes it with rapidly moving steel hammers.,Relevant
The hammermill uses another screen to control the maximum size of particle leaving the mill and discharge goes to a number of vibrating screens that separate out material of improper size before it is sent on to the next phase of production.,Relevant
With extrusion the most common method of brick forming pulverized material and water are fed into one end of a pug mill  which uses knives on a rotating shaft to cut through and fold together material in a shallow chamber.,Relevant
The blend is then fed into an extruder at the far end of the mill.,Relevant
The extruder usually consists of two chambers.,Irrelevant
The first removes air from the ground clay with a vacuum thereby preventing cracking and other defects.,Relevant
The second chamber a high pressure cylinder compacts the material so the auger can extrude it through the die.,Relevant
After it is compressed the plastic material is forced out of the chamber though a specially shaped die orifice.,Relevant
The cross section of the extruded column called the pug is formed into the shape of the die.,Relevant
Sections of desired length are cut to size with rotating knives or stiff wires.,Relevant
In molding soft wet clay is shaped in a mold usually a wooden box.,Relevant
The interior of the box is often coated with sand which provides the desired texture and facilitates removing the formed brick from the mold.,Relevant
Water can also be used to assist release.,Relevant
Pressing the third type of brick forming requires a material with low water content.,Irrelevant
The material is placed in a die and then compacted with a steel plunger set at a desired pressure.,Relevant
More regular in shape and sharper in outline than brick made with the other two methods pressed bricks also feature frogs.,Irrelevant
Chamfering machines were developed to produce a furrow in brick for such applications as paving.,Irrelevant
These machines use rollers to indent the brick as it is being extruded.,Irrelevant
They are sometimes equipped with wire cutters to do the chamfering and cutting in one step.,Irrelevant
Such machines can produce as many as 20 000 units per hour.,Irrelevant
The choice of sand coating also applied as the brick is extruded depends on how soft or hard the extruded material is.,Irrelevant
A continuous vibrating feeder is used to coat soft material whereas for textured material the coating may have to be brushed or rolled on.,Relevant
For harder materials a pressure roller or compressed air is used and for extremely hard materials sand blasting is required.,Relevant
Before the brick is fired it must be dried to remove excess moisture.,Relevant
If this moisture is not removed the water will burn off too quickly during firing causing cracking.,Relevant
Two types of dryers are used.,Irrelevant
Tunnel dryers use cars to move the brick through humidity controlled zones that prevent cracking.,Irrelevant
They consist of a long chamber through which the ware is slowly pushed.,Irrelevant
External sources of fan circulated hot air are forced into the dryer to speed the process.,Relevant
Automatic chamber dryers are also used especially in Europe.,Irrelevant
The extruded bricks are automatically placed in rows on two parallel bars.,Relevant
The bricks are then fed onto special racks with finger like devices that hold several pairs of bars in multiple layers.,Relevant
These racks are then transferred by rail mounted transfer cars or by lift trucks into the dryers.,Relevant
After drying the brick is loaded onto cars (usually automatically) and fired to  high temperatures in furnaces called kilns.,Relevant
In general the cars that moved the bricks through the drying process are also used to convey them through the tunnel kiln.,Relevant
These cars are pushed through the kiln s continuously maintained temperature zones at a specific rate that depends on the material.,Irrelevant
The majority of kilns in the United States use gas as a fuel source though a third of the brick currently produced is fired using solid fuels such as sawdust and coal.,Irrelevant
Tunnel kilns have changed in design from high load narrow width kilns to shorter lower set wider kilns that can fire more brick.,Irrelevant
This type of design has also led to high velocity long flame and low temperature flame burners which have improved temperature uniformity and lowered fuel consumption.,Irrelevant
After the brick is fired and cooled it is unloaded from the kiln car via the dehacking process which has been automated to the point where almost all manual brickhandling is eliminated.,Relevant
Automated setting machines have been developed that can set brick at rates of over 18 000 per hour and can rotate the brick 180 degrees.,Irrelevant
Usually set in rows eleven bricks wide a stack is wrapped with steel bands and fitted with plastic strips that serve as corner protectors.,Relevant
The packaged brick is then shipped to the job site where it is typically unloaded using boom trucks.,Relevant
Some bulletproof vests are custom made to meet the customer s protection needs or size.,Irrelevant
Most however meet standard protection regulations have standard clothing industry sizes (such as 38 long 32 short) and are sold in quantity.,Irrelevant
To make Kevlar the polymer poly para phenylene terephthalamide must first be produced in the laboratory.,Relevant
This is done through a process known as polymerization  which involves combining molecules into long chains.,Irrelevant
The resultant crystalline liquid with polymers in the shape of rods is then extruded through a spinneret (a small metal plate full of tiny holes that looks like a shower head) to form Kevlar yarn.,Relevant
The Kevlar fiber then passes through a cooling bath to help it harden.,Relevant
After being sprayed with water the synthetic fiber is wound onto rolls.,Relevant
The Kevlar manufacturer then typically sends the fiber to throwsters who twist the yarn to make it suitable for weaving.,Relevant
To make Kevlar cloth the yarns are woven in the simplest pattern plain or tabby weave which is merely the over and under pattern of threads that interlace alternatively.,Relevant
Unlike Kevlar the Spectra used in bulletproof vests is usually not woven.,Irrelevant
Instead the strong polyethylene polymer filaments are spun into fibers that are then laid parallel to each other.,Relevant
Resin is used to coat the fibers sealing them together to form a sheet of Spectra cloth.,Relevant
Two sheets of this cloth are then placed at right angles to one another and again bonded forming a nonwoven fabric that is next sandwiched between two sheets of polyethylene film.,Relevant
The vest shape can then be cut from the material.,Relevant
Kevlar cloth is sent in large rolls to the bulletproof vest manufacturer.,Relevant
The fabric is first unrolled onto a cutting table that must be long enough to allow several panels to be cut out at a time sometimes it can be as  long as 32.79 yards (30 meters).,Relevant
As many layers of the material as needed (as few as eight layers or as many as 25 depending on the level of protection desired) are laid out on the cutting table.,Relevant
A cut sheet similar to pattern pieces used for home sewing is then placed on the layers of cloth.,Relevant
For maximum use of the material some manufacturers use computer graphics systems to determine the optimal placement of the cut sheets.,Irrelevant
Using a hand held machine that performs like a jigsaw except that instead of a cutting wire it has a 5.91 inch (15 centimeter) cutting wheel similar to that on the end of a pizza cutter a worker cuts around the cut sheets to form panels which are then placed in precise stacks.,Relevant
While Spectra Shield generally does not require sewing as its panels are usually just cut and stacked in layers that go into tight fitting pouches in the vest a bulletproof vest made from Kevlar can be either quilt stitched or box stitched.,Irrelevant
Quilt stitching forms small diamonds of cloth separated by stitching whereas box stitching forms a large single box in the middle of the vest.,Relevant
Quilt stitching is more labor intensive and difficult and it provides a stiff panel that is hard to shift away from vulnerable areas.,Irrelevant
Box stitching on the other hand is fast and easy and allows the free movement of the vest.,Irrelevant
To sew the layers together workers place a stencil on top of the layers and rub chalk on the exposed areas of the panel   making a dotted line on the cloth.,Relevant
A sewer then stitches the layers together following the pattern made by the chalk.,Relevant
Next a size label is sewn onto the panel.,Relevant
The shells for the panels are sewn together in the same factory using standard industrial sewing machines and standard sewing practices.,Relevant
The panels are then slipped inside the shells and the accessories—such as the straps—are sewn on.,Relevant
The finished bulletproof vest is boxed and shipped to the customer.,Relevant
The manufacturing of candles consists of three steps preparation of the wicking preparation of the wax base and continuous molding or extrusion of the finished candles.,Irrelevant
The cotton or linen wicks are braided and then treated with chemicals or inorganic salt solutions so that they bend at a 90 degree angle when burning.,Relevant
This angle allows the end to remain in the outer mantle of the flame and causes it to be shortened naturally.,Irrelevant
If the wick is not treated it will burn too quickly and the flame will be extinguished by the melted wax.,Irrelevant
However if the wick burns too  slowly then the amount of exposed wick increases and the candle becomes dangerous.,Irrelevant
First the wax is heated and melted into a clear near liquid state in huge metal kettles.,Relevant
Wax melted by direct flame can become dark colored or can contain small pieces of carbon char.,Irrelevant
Next the molten wax must be carefully filtered to remove impurities that may interfere with the burning process.,Relevant
Any desired perfumes and dyes are added at this time.,Relevant
Although most wax arriving at the manufacturer conforms to strict purity standards many companies still filter their wax to be sure of a high quality finished product.,Relevant
Since the invention of Morgan s first candlemaking machine the construction of candles has been performed mainly by continuous molding machines although manual machines are still used by some companies.,Irrelevant
Continuous molding machines are designed to make candles in groups ranging anywhere from 50 to 500 per load.,Relevant
The entire process takes almost 30 minutes per load.,Irrelevant
Prior to the pouring of the wax the wick is pulled through the tip of the mold.,Relevant
This tip has a hole in it through which the wick passes from a spool located beneath the entire molding machine.,Irrelevant
The molds which are made of tin have polished interior surfaces and are slightly tapered for easier ejection of the finished candle.,Relevant
The wax is cooled to slightly above its melting point and poured into a molding table located above the molds.,Relevant
The wax then works its way into each mold the molds are pre heated so the wax will flow evenly into them.,Relevant
After the wax is poured a jacket around each mold is filled with cold water to speed up the solidification process.,Relevant
Once the wax has solidified the finished candles are pulled upwards out of the molds allowing the wicks to again thread through the molds in preparation for the next load of candles.,Relevant
The wicks are snipped and the process begins again.,Relevant
Excess wax is trimmed collected and re used.,Relevant
The continuous molding process is used to make cylindrical tapered or fluted candles as long as they can be easily ejected from the mold.,Relevant
An alternate method uses extrusion a process in which crushed paraffin wax is forced through a heated steel die under extreme pressure.,Irrelevant
At the same time the wax is consolidated around the wick.,Relevant
Unlike molding machines extrusion machines produce a continuous length of candle which is then cut into specific sizes.,Irrelevant
Next the tips of the candles are formed by rotation cutters and the candles are sent to an automated packing machine.,Relevant
A hydrocarbon (such as petroleum oil) and air are fed into a chamber.,Relevant
Part of the hydrocarbon undergoes incomplete combustion raising the temperature inside the chamber  to 2 012 3 092 degrees Fahrenheit (1100 1 700 degrees Celsius).,Relevant
At this temperature the unburned hydrocarbon decomposes to carbon black.,Irrelevant
The newly created carbon black is routed to a cooler where it is sprayed with water.,Relevant
The fine black substance is then recovered using a centrifugal cyclone or a bag filter.,Relevant
A large roll of coating paper (called the mill roll) unwinds and passes over another roll (the dope roll) sitting in a pan of carbon ink.,Relevant
The ink pan has been heated to between 168.8 and 179.6 degrees Fahrenheit (76 and 82 degrees Celsius).,Irrelevant
As the paper passes over this roll the heated ink is transferred onto one side of the paper.,Relevant
Next the paper passes over an equalizer rod which scrapes the coated paper to smooth it out and remove excess ink.,Relevant
The equalizer rod may be either smooth or ridged.,Irrelevant
The paper then passes over another roll the chill roll which cools and solidifies the ink onto the paper.,Relevant
Finally the completed paper is rewound onto another roll.,Relevant
In the case of manifold business forms the carbon paper is glued to another form so the paper must have an uncoated strip without carbon where the adhesive can be applied.,Relevant
To accomplish this in the Mayer method a strip of metal is simply placed in the proper place on the dope roll.,Relevant
This part of the roll thus picks up no ink from the ink pan to pass onto the paper.,Relevant
Another method called the Flexographic method can also be used to produce one time carbon paper.,Irrelevant
First a dope roll is coated with carbon ink from a heated pan below it.,Relevant
A metering roll contacts the dope roll and  squeezes the ink to a uniform thickness.,Relevant
The ink is then transferred to a third roll the print roll.,Relevant
Meanwhile the paper is fed from a mill roll onto an impression roll that contacts the print roll the third roll mentioned in step #5 above.,Relevant
When these two rolls come into contact ink from the print roll is passed onto the paper on the impression roll.,Relevant
The paper then passes over a chill roll that solidifies the ink before being rolled onto the rewind roll.,Relevant
For manifold business forms being produced with the Flexographic method a shallow groove is formed on the print roll.,Relevant
Where this groove contacts the paper on the impression roll no ink gets transferred.,Irrelevant
The final stage in the manufacture of one time carbon paper is perforation.,Irrelevant
First the carbon and the printed forms are slitted while they are being collated.,Relevant
Next the huge rolls of carbon paper are cut into forms or sheets of the proper size.,Relevant
If necessary line holes can also be punched into the paper.,Relevant
All of these operations are carried out automatically by a spot carbonizer processing machine.,Irrelevant
Finally the paper is stacked boxed and shipped to the customer.,Relevant
First wood pulp or cotton seeds are broken down into cellulose fibers through both physical crushing and chemical decomposition.,Relevant
Next the raw cellulose fibers are treated  with acetic acid and acetic anhydride to create a new compound triacetate.,Relevant
This material is then treated with a mixture of chemicals and water to produce the basic form of cellulose acetate.,Relevant
After being heated to remove all moisture the cellulose acetate is mixed with a plasticizing material similar to oil and the resulting cellulose acetate plastic is made into pellets or pelletized.,Relevant
 The pellets are melted into a liquid and spread over a wide flat conveyer belt to form extremely thin plastic sheets—it would take about five such sheets to equal the thickness of common paper.,Relevant
The completed backing or film is then wound on large rolls several thousand yards long to await the application of the adhesive.,Relevant
Modern adhesives differ from their nineteenth century precursors in that adhesomers  the synthetic polymers they re based on are inherently sticky and so require no additional tackifying agents.,Irrelevant
Such polymers are made from crude oil distillate that is chemically reacted to form alcohols and acids.,Irrelevant
These materials are then mixed with a hydrocarbon solvent that catalyzes their polymerization the process by which they combine to form a complex molecular chain made up of repeating structural sequences.,Relevant
The resulting adhesomer may be used in this form or redissolved with more coating solvents depending on its intended application.,Relevant
It is then stored until needed.,Relevant
First the non adhesive side of the backing is treated with a release agent that makes the tape easy to unwind.,Relevant
Before the adhesive is applied to the sticky side the side may be treated with a primer to anchor the adhesive.,Relevant
This coating is applied by routing the film over a large roller that rotates in an open vat of primer.,Relevant
As the tape moves over the roller it applies the primer.,Relevant
Once these surface coats have been applied the tape travels over heated drums (known as hot cans) that dry it.,Relevant
A very thin layer of pressure sensitive adhesive is metered onto the primed side of the tape which is then rolled into long ovens for high temperature drying.,Relevant
Once dried the tape is wound onto large jumbo rolls and routed over slicers that divide it into varying widths.,Relevant
The individual bands of tape are then wound around a small plastic core which is next fitted inside a plastic dispenser whose serrated edge can be used to cut lengths of tape.,Relevant
Both tape rolls and dispensers come in a variety of sizes to fit varying customer needs.,Irrelevant
It is important to mix the right amounts together to achieve the desired properties.,Irrelevant
Batch calculations are thus required which must take into consideration both physical properties and chemical compositions of the raw materials.,Irrelevant
Once the appropriate weight of each raw material is determined the raw materials must be mixed together.,Relevant
Once the ingredients are weighed they are added together into a shell mixer ribbon mixer or intensive mixer.,Relevant
A shell mixer consists of two cylinders joined into a V which rotates to tumble and mix the material.,Irrelevant
A ribbon mixer uses helical vanes and an intensive mixer uses rapidly revolving plows.,Irrelevant
This step further grinds the ingredients resulting in a finer particle size that improves the subsequent forming process (see step #4 below).,Irrelevant
If wet milling is first used the excess water is usually removed via spray drying.,Relevant
This involves pumping the slurry to an atomizer consisting of a rapidly rotating disk or nozzle.,Irrelevant
Droplets of the slip are dried as they are heated by a rising hot air column forming small free flowing granules that result in a powder suitable for forming.,Relevant
Most tile is formed by dry pressing.,Irrelevant
In this method the free flowing powder—containing organic binder or a low percentage of moisture—flows from a hopper into the forming die.,Irrelevant
The material is compressed in a steel cavity by steel plungers and is then ejected by the bottom plunger.,Relevant
Automated presses are used with operating pressures as high as 2 500 tons.,Irrelevant
Ceramic tile usually must be dried (at high relative humidity) after forming especially if a wet method is used.,Relevant
Drying which can take several days removes the water at a slow enough rate to prevent shrinkage cracks.,Irrelevant
Continuous or tunnel driers are used that are heated using gas or oil infrared lamps or microwave energy.,Relevant
Infrared drying is better suited for thin tile whereas microwave drying works better for thicker tile.,Irrelevant
Another method impulse drying uses pulses of hot air flowing in the transverse direction instead of continuously in the material flow direction.,Irrelevant
To prepare the glaze similar methods are used as for the tile body.,Irrelevant
After a batch formulation is calculated the raw materials are weighed mixed and dry or wet milled.,Relevant
The milled glazes are then applied using one of the many methods available.,Relevant
In centrifugal glazing or discing the glaze is fed through a rotating disc that flings or throws the glaze onto the tile.,Relevant
In the bell waterfall method a stream of glaze falls onto the tile as it passes on a conveyor underneath.,Relevant
Sometimes the glaze is simply sprayed on.,Irrelevant
For multiple glaze applications screen printing on under or between tile that have been wet glazed is used.,Relevant
In this process glaze is forced through a screen by a rubber squeegee or other device.,Relevant
After glazing the tile must be heated intensely to strengthen it and give it the desired porosity.,Relevant
Two types of ovens or  kilns are used for firing tile.,Irrelevant
Wall tile or tile that is prepared by dry grinding instead of wet milling (see #2 and #3 above) usually requires a two step process.,Relevant
In this process the tile goes through a low temperature firing called bisque firing before glazing.,Irrelevant
This step removes the volatiles from the material and most or all of the shrinkage.,Irrelevant
The body and glaze are then fired together in a process called glost firing.,Relevant
Both firing processes take place in a tunnel or continuous kiln which consists of a chamber through which the ware is slowly moved on a conveyor on refractory batts—shelves built of materials that are resistant to high temperatures—or in containers called saggers.,Irrelevant
Firing in a tunnel kiln can take two to three days with firing temperatures around 2 372 degrees Fahrenheit (1 300 degrees Celsius).,Irrelevant
After firing and testing the tile is ready to be packaged and shipped.,Relevant
Approximately 95 percent of the limestone produced in the United States is quarried.,Irrelevant
After a sufficient reserve (twenty five years worth is recommended) has been prospected the land that covers the deposit is removed with bulldozers and scrapers.,Relevant
If the chalk is close to the surface an open shelf quarry method can be used however this is very rare.,Relevant
Usually an open pit quarry method is used instead.,Irrelevant
Holes are drilled into the rock explosives are placed inside and the rock is blown apart.,Relevant
Depending on the nature of the deposit a pit can be enlarged laterally or vertically.,Relevant
Once comparatively large chunks of limestone have been quarried they need to be transported to crushing machines where they are pulverized to meet the demands of the chalk industry.,Relevant
The first step is primary crushing.,Relevant
Various crushers exist but the principle is the same all compress the stone with jaws or a cone or shatter it through impact.,Irrelevant
Secondary crushing is accomplished by smaller crushers that work at higher speeds producing pebbles which are then ground and pulverized.,Relevant
The next phase wet grinding washes away impurities.,Relevant
It is used to make the fine grade of limestone necessary to make chalk suitable for writing purposes.,Irrelevant
Wet grinding is carried out in ball mills—rotating steel drums with steel balls inside that pulverize the chalk until it is very fine.,Irrelevant
Gypsum like limestone is also quarried and pulverized.,Relevant
The major difference in processing gypsum is that it must be dehydrated to form calcium sulfate the major component of colored chalk.,Irrelevant
This is done in a kettle a large combustion chamber in which the gypsum is heated to between 244 and 253 degrees Fahrenheit (116 121 degrees Celsius).,Relevant
It is allowed to boil until it has been reduced by twelve to fifteen percent at which point its water content will have been reduced from 20.9 percent to between 5 and 6 percent.,Relevant
To further reduce the water the gypsum is reheated to about 402 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius) at which point it is removed from the kettle.,Relevant
By now almost all of the water has evaporated leaving calcium sulfate.,Irrelevant
The particles of chalk or calcium sulfate are now conveyed to vibrating screens that sift out the finer material.,Relevant
The ensuing fine chalk is then washed dried packed in bags and shipped to the manufacturer.,Relevant
Upon receiving chalk or calcium sulfate the chalk factory usually grinds the materials again to render them smooth and uniformly fine.,Relevant
To make white classroom chalk the manufacturer adds water to form a thick slurry with the consistency of clay.,Relevant
The slurry is then placed into and extruded from a die—an orifice of the desired long thin shape.,Relevant
Cut into lengths of approximately 24.43 inches (62 centimeters) the sticks are next placed on a sheet that contains places for five such sticks.,Relevant
The sheet is then placed in an oven where the chalk cures for four days at 188 degrees Fahrenheit (85 degrees Celsius).,Relevant
After it has cured the sticks are cut into 80 millimeters lengths.,Relevant
Pigments (dry natural colored materials) are mixed in with the calcium carbonate while both are dry (the procedure is similar to sifting flour and baking powder together before adding liquid as in a cake recipe).,Relevant
Water is then added to the mixture which is then baked in the same manner as white classroom chalk.,Relevant
Placed in small boxes the completed chalk sticks are stacked in large boxes to be shipped to supply stores.,Relevant
Although cheese making is a linear process it involves many factors.,Irrelevant
Numerous varieties of cheese exist because ending the simple preparation process at different points can produce different cheeses as can varying additives or procedures.,Irrelevant
Cheese making has long been considered a delicate process.,Irrelevant
Attempts to duplicate the success of an old cheese factory have been known to fail because conditions at a new factory do not favor the growth of the proper bacteria.,Irrelevant
Small cheese factories accept either morning milk (which is richer) evening milk or both.,Irrelevant
Because it is generally purchased from small dairies which don t pasteurize this milk contains the bacteria necessary to produce lactic acid one of the agents that triggers curdling.,Irrelevant
The cheese makers let the milk sit until enough lactic acid has formed to begin producing the particular type of cheese they re making.,Relevant
Depending on the type of cheese being produced the cheese makers may then heat the ripening milk.,Relevant
This process differs slightly at large cheese factories which purchase pasteurized milk and must consequently add a culture of bacteria to produce lactic acid.,Irrelevant
The next step is to add animal or vegetable rennet to the milk furthering its separation into curds and whey.,Relevant
Once formed the curds are cut both vertically and horizontally with knives.,Relevant
In large factories huge vats of curdled milk are cut vertically using sharp multi bladed wire knives reminiscent of oven racks.,Relevant
The same machine then agitates the curds and slices them horizontally.,Relevant
If the cutting is done manually the curds are cut both ways using a large two handled knife.,Relevant
Soft cheeses are cut into big chunks while hard cheeses are cut into tiny chunks.,Relevant
(For cheddar for instance the space between the knives is about one twentieth of an inch [half a centimeter]).,Irrelevant
After cutting the curds may be heated to hasten the separation from the whey but they are more typically left alone.,Relevant
When separation is complete the whey is drained.,Relevant
Moisture must then be removed from the curds although the amount removed depends on the type of cheese.,Relevant
For some types with high moisture contents the whey draining process removes sufficient moisture.,Relevant
Other types require the curds to be cut heated and or filtered to get rid of excess moisture.,Relevant
To make cheddar cheese for example cheese makers cheddar  or finely chop the curd.,Irrelevant
To make hard dry cheeses such as parmesan cheese makers first cheddar and then cook the curd.,Irrelevant
Regardless if the curds are to be aged they are then put into molds.,Relevant
Here they are pressed to give the proper shape and size.,Relevant
Soft cheeses such as cottage cheese are not aged.,Relevant
At this stage the cheese may be inoculated with a flavoring mold bathed in brine or wrapped in cloth or hay before being deposited in a place of the proper temperature and humidity to age.,Relevant
Some cheeses are aged for a month some for up to several years.,Relevant
Ageing sharpens the flavor of the cheese for example cheddar aged more than two years is appropriately labeled extra sharp.,Irrelevant
Some cheeses may develop a rind naturally as their surfaces dry.,Irrelevant
Other rinds may form from the growth of bacteria that has been sprayed on the surface of the cheese.,Irrelevant
Still other cheeses are washed and this process encourages bacterial growth.,Relevant
In place of or in addition to rinds cheeses can be sealed in cloth or wax.,Relevant
For local eating this may be all the packaging that is necessary.,Relevant
However large quantities of cheese are packaged for sale in distant countries.,Relevant
Such cheeses may be heavily salted for export (such as Roquefort) or sealed in impermeable plastic or foil.,Relevant
Edible yet inferior cheeses can be saved and made into processed cheese.,Relevant
Cheeses such as Emmental (commonly called Swiss) Gruyere (similar to Swiss) Colby or cheddar are cut up and very finely ground.,Irrelevant
After this powder has been mixed with water to form a paste other ingredients such as salt fillers emulsifiers preservatives and flavorings are added.,Relevant
The mixture is then heated under controlled conditions.,Relevant
While still warm and soft the cheese paste is extruded into long ribbons that are sliced.,Relevant
The small sheets of cheese are then put onto a plastic or foil sheet and wrapped by a machine.,Relevant
While the specific ingredients in gum might be a secret the process for making gum is not.,Irrelevant
The first chewing gum making machine wasn t even patented and today the procedure is considered standard throughout the industry.,Irrelevant
If natural latex is to be used it must first be harvested and processed.,Relevant
The tall 32.79 yard (30 meter) chicle tree is scored with a series of shallow Xs enabling the chicle to flow down into a bucket.,Relevant
After a significant amount of chicle has accumulated it is strained and placed in large kettles.,Relevant
Stirred constantly it is boiled until it reduces to two thirds of its original volume.,Relevant
It is then poured into greased wooden molds and shipped.,Relevant
The natural and or artificial gum bases are first ground into a coarse meal and mixed to ensure uniform consistency.,Relevant
The blend is then placed in a warm room to dry for a day or two.,Relevant
During drying hot air continually passes over the mixture.,Relevant
Next the gum base is cooked in kettles at 243 degrees Fahrenheit (116 degrees Celsius) until it has melted into a thick syrup.,Relevant
To purify it workers pass it through screens and place it in a high speed centrifuge before refiltering it this time through finer screens.,Relevant
The gum base is now ready for additives.,Irrelevant
It is placed in kettles to be cooked and additional ingredients are stirred in by large steel blades.,Relevant
First extremely fine powdered sugar and corn syrup are added.,Relevant
Flavorings are added next followed by softeners.,Relevant
When the mixture is smooth enough it is rolled out onto belts and cooled by being exposed to cold air.,Relevant
The next step is kneading.,Irrelevant
For several hours machines gently pummel the mass  of chewing gum until it is properly rubbery and smooth.,Relevant
Large chunks are then chopped off the mass to be flattened by rollers until they reach the proper thickness of nearly 17 inches (about 43 cm).,Relevant
During this process the sheet of chewing gum is dusted with powdered sugar to prepare it for cutting.,Relevant
A cutting machine first scores the sheet in a pattern of rectangles each 1.3 inches (3.3 centimeters) long and 449 of an inch (1.14 centimeters) wide.,Relevant
The sheet is then put aside at the proper temperature and humidity to season.,Relevant
Once seasoned the gum sheets are broken into sticks wrapped in aluminum foil or wax paper wrapped in paper and put into plastic packs that are then sealed.,Relevant
Put into boxes or plastic bags the gum is ready to be shipped to retail outlets.,Relevant
Amazingly gum balls make up only three percent of chewing gum sales yet their unique merchandising makes them intriguing.,Irrelevant
Gumballs are made by scoring a cylinder of gum twice to form balls which are then stored several hours at 55 60 degrees Fahrenheit (13 16 degrees Celsius) to harden.,Relevant
The balls are put into huge kettles to be coated with a flavored and colored sucrose solution.,Relevant
After seven hours the coated balls are dried with hot air then rolled in beeswax or other wax to make them shiny.,Relevant
The nature of gumball machines determined the next step.,Irrelevant
An enclosed plastic globe is subject to interior condensation.,Relevant
The water collected ruins untreated gumballs so they are usually coated with a plastic water repellent glaze to protect them.,Relevant
Candy coated gums are made in essentially the same way their final destination being boxes not gum ball machines.,Relevant
A recent development has been the introduction of gums with a liquid center.,Relevant
To make this gum the gum base is extruded to form a hollow rope.,Relevant
The liquid is then fed into the hollow area and a cutting machine chops the ropes into bite size pieces and wraps them.,Relevant
Once a company has received a shipment of cocoa beans at its processing plant the beans are roasted first on screens and then in revolving cylinders through which heated air is blown.,Relevant
Over a period of 30 minutes to 2 hours the moisture in the beans is reduced from about seven percent to about one percent.,Relevant
The roasting process triggers a browning reaction in which more than 300 different chemicals present in the cocoa beans interact.,Relevant
The beans now begin to develop the rich flavor we associate with chocolate.,Irrelevant
Roasting also causes the shells to open and break away from the nibs (the meat of the bean).,Relevant
This separation process can be completed by blowing air across the beans as they go through a giant winnowing machine called a cracker and fanner which loosens the hulls from the beans without crushing them.,Irrelevant
The hulls now separated from the nibs are usually sold as either mulch or fertilizer.,Relevant
They are also sometimes used as a commercial boiler fuel.,Irrelevant
Next the roasted nibs undergo broyage  a process of crushing that takes place in a grinder made of revolving granite blocks.,Relevant
The design of the grinder may vary but most resemble old fashioned flour mills.,Irrelevant
The final product of this grinding process made up of small particles of the nib suspended in oil is a thick syrup known as chocolate liquor.,Irrelevant
The next step is refining during which the liquor is further ground between sets of revolving metal drums.,Relevant
Each successive rolling is faster than the preceding one because the liquor is becoming smoother and flows easier.,Relevant
The ultimate goal is to reduce the size of the particles in the liquor to about 001 inch (00254 centimeters).,Irrelevant
If the chocolate being produced is to be cocoa powder from which hot chocolate and baking mixes are made the chocolate liquor may be dutched  a process so named because it was invented by the Dutch chocolate maker Conrad van Houten.,Relevant
In the dutching process the liquor is treated with an alkaline solution usually potassium carbonate that raises its pH from 5.5 to 7 or 8.,Relevant
This increase darkens the color of the cocoa renders its flavor more mild and reduces the tendency of the nib particles to form clumps in the liquor.,Relevant
The powder that eventually ensues is called dutch cocoa.,Irrelevant
The next step in making cocoa powder is defatting the chocolate liquor or removing large amounts of butter from it.,Relevant
This is done by further compressing the liquor between rollers until about half of the fat from its cocoa beans has been released.,Relevant
The resulting solid material commonly called press cake  is then broken chopped or crushed before being sifted to produce cocoa powder.,Relevant
When additives such as sugar or other sweeteners have been blended this cocoa powder becomes a modern version of chocalatl.,Relevant
If the chocolate being produced is to become candy the press cake is remixed with some of the removed cocoa butter.,Relevant
The restored cocoa butter is necessary for texture and consistency and different types of chocolate require different amounts of cocoa butter.,Irrelevant
The mixture now undergoes a process known as conching  in which it is continuously turned and ground in a huge open vat.,Relevant
The process s name derives from older vats which resembled large conch shells.,Irrelevant
The conching process can last from between three hours to three days (more time is not necessarily better however).,Relevant
This is the most important step in making chocolate.,Irrelevant
The speed and temperature of the mixing are critical in determining the quality of the final product.,Irrelevant
Another crucial aspect of conching is the time and rate at which other ingredients are added.,Irrelevant
The ingredients added during conching determine what type of chocolate is produced sweet chocolate consists of chocolate liquor cocoa butter sugar and vanilla milk chocolate contains sweet chocolate with powdered whole milk or whole liquid milk.,Irrelevant
At the end of the conching process the chocolate is poured into molds cooled cut and wrapped.,Relevant
First the coffee cherries must be harvested a process that is still done manually.,Relevant
Next the cherries are dried and husked using one of two methods.,Relevant
The dry method is an older primitive and labor intensive process of distributing the cherries in the sun raking them several times a day and allowing them to dry.,Relevant
When they have dried to the point at which they contain only 12 percent water the beans husks become shriveled.,Relevant
At this stage they are hulled either by hand or by a machine.,Relevant
In employing the wet method the hulls are removed before the beans have dried.,Relevant
Although the fruit is initially processed in a pulping machine that removes most of the material surrounding the beans some of this glutinous covering remains after pulping.,Relevant
This residue is removed by letting the beans ferment in tanks where their natural enzymes digest the gluey substance over a period of 18 to 36 hours.,Relevant
Upon removal from the fermenting tank the beans are washed dried by exposure to hot air and put into large mechanical stirrers called hullers.,Relevant
 There the beans last parchment covering the pergamino crumbles and falls away easily.,Irrelevant
The huller then polishes the bean to a clean glossy finish.,Relevant
The beans are then placed on a conveyor belt that carries them past workers who remove sticks and other debris.,Relevant
Next they are graded according to size the location and altitude of the plantation where they were grown drying and husking methods and taste.,Relevant
All these factors contribute to certain flavors that consumers will be able to select thanks in part to the grade.,Irrelevant
Once these processes are completed workers select and pack particular types and grades of beans to fill orders from the various roasting companies that will finish preparing the beans.,Relevant
When beans (usually robusta) are harvested under the undesirable conditions of hot humid countries or coastal regions they must be shipped as quickly as possible because such climates encourage insects and fungi that can severely damage a shipment.,Relevant
When the coffee beans arrive at a roasting plant they are again cleaned and sorted by mechanical screening devices to remove leaves bark and other remaining debris.,Relevant
If the beans are not to be decaffeinated they are ready for roasting.,Relevant
If the coffee is to be decaffeinated it is now processed using either a solvent or a water method.,Relevant
In the first process the coffee beans are treated with a solvent (usually methylene chloride) that leaches out the caffeine.,Relevant
If this decaffeination method is used the beans must be thoroughly washed to remove traces of the solvent prior to roasting.,Relevant
The other method entails steaming the beans to bring the caffeine to the surface and then scraping off this caffeine rich layer.,Relevant
The beans are roasted in huge commercial roasters according to procedures and specifications which vary among manufacturers (specialty shops usually purchase beans directly from the growers and roast them on site).,Relevant
The most common process entails placing the beans in a large metal cylinder and blowing hot air into it.,Relevant
An older method called singeing  calls for placing the beans in a metal cylinder that is then rotated over an electric gas or charcoal heater.,Irrelevant
Regardless of the particular method used roasting gradually raises the temperature of the beans to between 431 and 449 degrees Fahrenheit (220 230 degrees Celsius).,Relevant
This triggers the release of steam carbon monoxide carbon dioxide and other volatiles reducing the weight of the beans by 14 to 23 percent.,Relevant
The pressure of these escaping internal gases causes the beans to swell and they increase their volume by 30 to 100 percent.,Relevant
Roasting also darkens the color of the beans gives them a crumbly texture and triggers the chemical reactions that imbue the coffee with its familiar aroma (which it has not heretofore possessed).,Irrelevant
After leaving the roaster the beans are placed in a cooling vat wherein they are stirred while cold air is blown over them.,Relevant
If the coffee being prepared is high quality the cooled beans will now be sent through an electronic sorter equipped to detect and eliminate beans that emerged from the roasting process too light or too dark.,Relevant
If the coffee is to be pre ground the manufacturer mills it immediately after roasting.,Relevant
Special types of grinding have been developed for each of the different types of coffee makers as each functions best with coffee ground to a specific fineness.,Irrelevant
If the coffee is to be instant it is I V brewed with water in huge percolators after the grinding stage.,Relevant
An extract is clarified from the brewed coffee and sprayed into a large cylinder.,Relevant
As it falls downward through this cylinder it enters a warm air stream that converts it into a dry powder.,Relevant
Because it is less vulnerable to flavor and aroma loss than other types of coffee whole bean coffee is usually packaged in foil lined bags.,Relevant
If it is to retain its aromatic qualities pre ground coffee must be hermetically sealed it is usually packaged in impermeable plastic film  aluminum foil  or cans.,Relevant
Instant coffee picks up moisture easily so it is vacuum packed in tin cans or glass jars before being shipped to retail stores.,Relevant
The twenty component parts of the typical combination lock are formed drawn cut pressed and molded on a variety of machines both manual and automatic.,Relevant
The lever locking latch and disc shaft are all made by injection molding a process in which molten zamak is poured into a mold and subjected to heat and pressure until it solidifies into the shape of the mold.,Relevant
Although the post is shaped at room temperature it is also formed under high pressure.,Relevant
The combination disc and the cam are made of cold rolled—passed under huge rolls without being heated—flat strip steel after being cold rolled the steel is put in a blanking die a sophisticated cookie cutter which cuts (or blanks) out the properly shaped piece.,Relevant
The internal disc spring is made from stainless steel round wire and produced on a spring winder that automatically twists and turns the wire to form the traditional coil spring.,Irrelevant
The shackle collar like the combination disc and cam is made from cold rolled flat strip steel that is blanked in a blanking die.,Irrelevant
The inner case is produced from flat steel strip and drawn to a cup configuration.,Irrelevant
This process requires great pressure to stretch and compress the material as it is pressed or drawn around a die whose shape it takes.,Relevant
The outer case is manufactured similarly to the inner case but from stainless steel sheet instead of strip.,Relevant
The back cover also stainless steel is blanked in a blanking die.,Relevant
The durable shackle is made of round bar stock and machined on a screw machine then formed to its U shape and notched to accept the locking latch.,Irrelevant
It is finally annealed (heated to great temperature before being quenched in water) to make it resistant to hacksaws and bolt cutters.,Relevant
The combination dial also zamak is injection molded then chromized.,Relevant
This process involves heating the part in a salt bath rich in chromium.,Relevant
The steel absorbs the chromium which hardens on the surface as it cools rapidly.,Relevant
The dial is painted black and white wiped which leaves the numbers highlighted against the black face.,Relevant
Several plating and finishing processes can be used to protect the components against corrosion.,Relevant
The lever disc shaft combination cam and dial are chromized.,Relevant
The inner case shackle collar and lever post are all cadmium plated.,Relevant
The shackle and locking latch are copper nickel plated.,Relevant
The outer case of stainless steel is mechanically polished to enhance luster.,Relevant
Assembly of the components is precise with the back plate disc shaft combination cam and spacers forming one subassembly.,Relevant
The outer and inner cases are riveted together and then pierced at the point where the shackle is inserted.,Relevant
The combination dial outer and inner case unit and combination cam are then fastened together.,Relevant
Finally these sub assemblies and the remaining parts are fitted together.,Relevant
The lock case is closed and the edges folded over and sealed.,Relevant
Conventional hardware fasteners that can be released with the proper tool are not used.,Irrelevant
The remaining operation is the application of a removable tag or label to the lock.,Relevant
On this tag is the combination determined randomly by machine draw.,Irrelevant
Lock manufacturers today jealously guard their combination setting procedures.,Irrelevant
A typical combination lock is sold in blister pack a rigid molded plastic with cardboard backing although locks may also be individually boxed.,Relevant
Manufacturing a combine begins with the delivery of large coils of sheet steel to the sheet metal shop.,Relevant
The coil steel is loaded into one of several machines that make up the cut to length line in the sheet metal shop.,Relevant
Computer controlled rollers pull the steel from the coil flatten it and feed it into a cutting machine.,Relevant
The steel is cut into blanks basic rectangular shapes that are later welded together to form the body of the combine and the top mounted grain tank.,Relevant
For maximum efficiency the cut to length line operates on pre determined batch schedules.,Relevant
The basic metal shapes cut from the steel coils are used during the day or week that they are cut so there is no storage of basic components.,Relevant
From the cut to length line the blanks are moved to the cut to shape line.,Relevant
In a laser punch press an industrial laser cuts complex shapes from them and drills holes for shafts piping and bolts.,Relevant
Then the press exerts up to 1 000 tons of pressure to bend the steel into final form.,Relevant
Small batches of parts are moved from the sheet metal shop to the welding area where cellular manufacturing techniques are used for speed and quality control.,Relevant
In cellular manufacturing several manufacturing functions are grouped in one area so parts can be quickly passed from one operation to the next and several subcomponents are loaded on a transportation skid before being sent to the next assembly step.,Relevant
Thus all the parts needed to assemble a batch of components are present when the skid arrives.,Relevant
To further enhance efficiency much of the welding of sheet steel components is done by powerful computer controlled units.,Relevant
Hydraulic lifts properly position components that are then welded by one armed robots.,Relevant
As the smaller components of the combine are assembled the body begins to take shape.,Relevant
  In the form of a simple frame it is now attached to an overhead loadbar conveyor track that carries it through the remainder of the production process.,Relevant
After the body has been welded the overhead conveyor transports it to and submerges it in the paint tank a huge 48 000 gallon (181 776 liters) tank full of electrostatically charged paint.,Relevant
Because combines are used and stored outside their paint must be able to resist the harmful effects of sunshine and moisture and the electrostatic process insures that it will.,Irrelevant
In electrostatic painting the metal combine body is given a positive electrical charge while the water based paint is given a negative charge.,Relevant
Because opposite electrical charges are attracted to each other the positively charged body attracts the negatively charged paint causing the paint to bond to the combine tightly and completely (only rubber gaskets and other non metallic parts are not touched by the paint).,Irrelevant
After the conveyor lifts the combine body from the paint bath it suspends it over the tank for a few moments so that excess paint can drip off.,Relevant
The body is then moved into a 363 degree Fahrenheit (182 degrees Celsius) oven where the paint is baked to a hard rust resistant finish.,Relevant
After painting the combine body is carried through the assembly line so that other major components may be installed.,Relevant
Where necessary these components have also been dipped in the electrostatic paint bath.,Relevant
Once the axles hubs and tires have been added the combine is removed from the overhead conveyor and is towed from station to station.,Relevant
After the combine body the other significant structural assembly is the grain tank.,Irrelevant
In the grain tank assembly area skilled workers use a complex positioning and welding system to complete more than 500 separate welds in two 10 Y2 minute sequences.,Irrelevant
Automated sheet metal handling equipment pulls flat sheets from skids fresh from the cut to shape line in the sheet metal shop.,Irrelevant
These sheets are then loaded onto a huge metal table the size of a two car garage.,Relevant
Next hydraulic cylinders position the side panels as human welders scramble to secure the corners of the grain tank with tack welds.,Relevant
When the human welders are out of harm s way robot arms swing into action making hundreds of welds in a few minutes.,Relevant
After the body and grain tank have been painted they are brought to the final assembly line where 22 different assembly operations are performed.,Relevant
Major components like the engine module are installed wiring and hydraulic lines are connected and all systems are tested.,Relevant
Oil anti freeze and gas are added and the engine is started.,Relevant
On the outside a final coating of clear polyurethane is applied across the top of the wide flat surfaces of the cab grain tank and engine module and decals are applied.,Relevant
Compact discs must be manufactured under very clean and dust free conditions in a clean room which is kept free from virtually all dust particles.,Irrelevant
The air in the room is specially filtered to keep out dirt and occupants of the room must wear special clothing.,Relevant
Because an average dust particle is 100 times larger than the average pit and land on a CD even the smallest dust particle can render a disc useless.,Irrelevant
The original music is first recorded onto a digital audio tape.,Relevant
Next the audio program is transferred to a 3 4 inch (1.9 centimeters) video tape and then data (called subcodes) used for indexing and tracking the music is added to the audio data on the tape.,Relevant
At this point the tape is called a pre master.,Irrelevant
The pre master tape will be used to create the disc master (also called the glass master) which is a disc made from specially prepared glass.,Irrelevant
The glass is polished to a smooth finish and coated with a layer of adhesive and a layer of photoresist material.,Relevant
The disc is approximately 9.45 inches (240 millimeters) in diameter and 24 of an inch (six millimeters) thick.,Irrelevant
After the adhesive and photoresist are applied the disc is cured in an oven.,Relevant
Next both the pre master tape and the disc master are put into a complex laser cutting machine.,Relevant
The machine plays back the audio program on the pre master tape.,Relevant
As it does so the program is transferred to a device called a CD encoder which in turn generates an electrical signal.,Relevant
This signal powers a laser beam which exposes or cuts grooves into the photoresist coating on the glass disc (the disc master).,Relevant
The grooves that have been exposed are then etched away by chemicals these etched grooves will form the pits of the CD s surface.,Relevant
A metal coating usually silver is then applied to the disc.,Relevant
The disc master now contains the exact pit and land track that the finished CD will have.,Irrelevant
After etching the disc master undergoes a process called electroforming in which another metal layer such as nickel is deposited onto the disc s surface.,Relevant
The phrase electro is used because the metal is deposited using an electric current.,Irrelevant
The disc is bathed in an electrolytic solution such as nickel solphamate and as the electric current is applied a layer of metal forms on the disc master.,Relevant
The thickness of this metal layer is strictly controlled.,Relevant
Next the newly applied metal layer is pulled apart from the disc master which is put aside.,Relevant
The metal layer or father contains a negative impression of the disc master track in other words the track on the metal layer is an exact replica but in reverse of the track on the disc master.,Relevant
The metal father then undergoes further electroforming to produce one or more mothers which are simply metal layers that again have positive impressions of the original disc master track.,Relevant
Using the same electroforming process each mother then produces a son (also called a stamper) with a negative impression of the track.,Relevant
It is the son that is then used to create the actual CD.,Relevant
After being separated from the mother the metal son is rinsed dried polished and put in a punching machine that cuts out the center hole and forms the desired outside diameter.,Relevant
The metal son is then put into a hollow cavity—a die—of the proper disc shape in an injection molding machine.,Relevant
Molten polycarbonate plastic is then poured into this die to form around the metal son.,Relevant
Once cooled the plastic is shaped like the son with the pits and grooves—once again in a positive impression of the original disc master track—formed into one side.,Relevant
The center hole is then punched out of plastic disc which is transparent at  this stage.,Relevant
Next the disc is scanned for flaws such as water bubbles dust particles and warps.,Relevant
If a flaw is found the disc must be discarded.,Relevant
If the disc meets the quality standards I it is then coated with an extremely thin reflective layer of aluminum.,Relevant
The coating is applied using vacuum deposition.,Relevant
In this process aluminum is put into a vacuum chamber and heated to the point of evaporation which allows it to be applied evenly to the plastic disc.,Relevant
Finally a clear acrylic plastic is applied to the disc to help protect the underlying layers from physical damage such as scratches.,Relevant
After the label is printed generally using a silk screening process the compact disc is complete and ready for packaging and shipment.,Relevant
Purchased from outside contractors the laser and the photodiode are installed beneath the disc clamp.,Relevant
The various lenses and mirrors in the assembly must be properly spaced and aligned so that they can focus and direct light as necessary.,Relevant
The whole assembly is then housed in a plastic case.,Relevant
The case is made by the one of the usual plastic forming processes such as extrusion or injection molding while the lenses and mirrors (usually silicon) are cut into the proper shape and then finely polished with abrasives.,Relevant
The semiconducting photodiode is made by preparing and polishing a substance such as silicon or germanium and then adding impurities to create layers.,Irrelevant
Electrical contacts are then added.,Relevant
After the optical components are in position the gears and belt that will help to position the optical pick up are put in place.,Relevant
Next the motor that will move the optical pick up is connected to the gears and belt and placed on the chassis.,Relevant
The loading tray is now centered and the spindle motor that will rotate the disc is installed.,Irrelevant
After the clamp to which the optical pick up has been attached is positioned adjacent to the loading tray the tray clamp and pick up motor are installed in the loading drawer which is placed in the CD player s cabinet.,Relevant
Last to be assembled are the electronic components.,Irrelevant
Designed by engineers using computer aided design (CAD) packages the circuit boards consist of a copper clad base that has a pattern transferred onto it (masking) through screen printing or a similar method.,Irrelevant
After being coated with a photosensitive material the patterned areas are etched away chemically to create a multi layered board—the layers comprise the various transistors and capacitors that make up the circuits.,Relevant
The tiny microchips (usually made of silicon) that are mounted on the board are made in the same way except on a much smaller scale.,Irrelevant
Depending on the manufacturer the CD player may have one large circuit board or several smaller boards.,Irrelevant
After they have been attached to the panel or panels the circuits are attached to the CD player s front control panel the switch assembly and finally the power supply.,Relevant
Once the various subassemblies are ready they are connected and interfaced together to complete the final assembly.,Relevant
Most of the work performed at this stage is done by human workers.,Irrelevant
The CD player is now tested and sent for packaging.,Relevant
The manufacture of concrete is fairly simple.,Irrelevant
First the cement (usually Portland cement) is prepared.,Relevant
Next the other ingredients—aggregates (such as sand or gravel) admixtures (chemical additives) any necessary fibers and water—are mixed together with the cement to form concrete.,Relevant
The concrete is then shipped to the work site and placed compacted and cured.,Relevant
The limestone silica and alumina that make up Portland cement are dry ground into a very fine powder mixed together in predetermined proportions preheated and calcined (heated to a high temperature that will burn off impurities without fusing the ingredients).,Relevant
Next the material is burned in a large rotary kiln at 2 550 degrees Fahrenheit (1 400 degrees Celsius).,Relevant
At this temperature the material partially fuses into a substance known as clinker.,Irrelevant
A modern kiln can produce as much as 6 200 tons of clinker a day.,Irrelevant
The clinker is then cooled and ground to a fine powder in a tube or ball mill.,Relevant
A ball mill is a rotating drum filled with steel balls of different sizes (depending on the desired fineness of the cement) that crush and grind the clinker.,Relevant
Gypsum is added during the grinding process.,Relevant
The final composition consists of several compounds tricalcium silicate dicalcium silicate tricalcium aluminate and tetracalcium aluminoferrite.,Irrelevant
The cement is then mixed with the other ingredients aggregates (sand gravel or crushed stone) admixtures fibers and water.,Relevant
Aggregates are pre blended or added at the ready mix concrete plant under normal operating conditions.,Relevant
The mixing operation uses rotation or stirring to coat the surface of the aggregate with cement paste and to blend the other ingredients uniformly.,Irrelevant
A variety of batch or continuous mixers are used.,Irrelevant
Fibers if desired can be added by a variety of methods including direct spraying premixing impregnating or hand laying up.,Relevant
Silica fume is often used as a dispersing or densifying agent.,Relevant
Once the concrete mixture is ready it is transported to the work site.,Relevant
There are many methods of transporting concrete including wheelbarrows buckets belt conveyors   special trucks and pumping.,Irrelevant
Pumping transports large quantities of concrete over large distances through pipelines using a system consisting of a hopper a pump and the pipes.,Relevant
Pumps come in several types—the horizontal piston pump with semi rotary valves and small portable pumps called squeeze pumps.,Irrelevant
A vacuum provides a continuous flow of concrete with two rotating rollers squeezing a flexible pipe to move the concrete into the delivery pipe.,Irrelevant
Once at the site the concrete must be placed and compacted.,Relevant
These two operations are performed almost simultaneously.,Relevant
Placing must be done so that segregation of the various ingredients is avoided and full compaction—with all air bubbles eliminated—can be achieved.,Relevant
Whether chutes or buggies are used position is important in achieving these goals.,Relevant
The rates of placing and of compaction should be equal the latter is usually accomplished using internal or external vibrators.,Irrelevant
An internal vibrator uses a poker housing a motor driven shaft.,Irrelevant
When the poker is inserted into the concrete controlled vibration occurs to compact the concrete.,Relevant
External vibrators are used for precast or thin in situ sections having a shape or thickness unsuitable for internal vibrators.,Relevant
These type of vibrators are rigidly clamped to the formwork which rests on an elastic support.,Irrelevant
Both the form and the concrete are vibrated.,Relevant
Vibrating tables are also used where a table produces vertical vibration by using two shafts rotating in opposite directions.,Relevant
Once it is placed and compacted the concrete must cured before it is finished to make sure that it doesn t dry too quickly.,Relevant
Concrete s strength is influenced by its moisture level during the hardening process as the cement solidifies the concrete shrinks.,Irrelevant
If site constraints prevent the concrete from contracting tensile stresses will develop weakening the concrete.,Irrelevant
To minimize this problem concrete must be kept damp during the several days it requires to set and harden.,Relevant
Incoming oil seeds are passed over magnets to remove any trace metal before being dehulled deskinned or otherwise stripped of all extraneous material.,Relevant
In the case of cotton the ginned seeds must be stripped of their lint as well as dehulled.,Relevant
In the case of corn the kernel must undergo milling to separate the germ.,Relevant
The stripped seeds or nuts are then ground into coarse meal to provide more surface area to be pressed.,Relevant
Mechanized grooved rollers or hammer mills crush the material to the proper consistency.,Relevant
The meal is then heated to facilitate the extraction of the oil.,Relevant
While the procedure allows more oil to be pressed out more impurities are also pressed out with the oil and these must be removed before the oil can be deemed edible.,Relevant
The heated meal is then fed continuously into a screw press which increases the pressure progressively as the meal passes through a slotted barrel.,Relevant
Pressure generally increases from 68 950 to 20 6850 kilopascals as the oil is squeezed out from the slots in the barrel where it can be recovered.,Relevant
Soybeans are usually not pressed at all before solvent extraction because they have relatively little oil but most oil seeds with more oil are pressed and solvent treated.,Relevant
After the initial oil has been recovered from the screw press the oil cake remaining in the press is processed by solvent extraction to attain the maximum yield.,Relevant
A volatile hydrocarbon (most commonly hexane) dissolves the oil out of the oil cake which is then recovered by distilling the light solvent out.,Relevant
The Blaw Knox Rotocell is used to meet the demands of the United States soybean oil industry.,Relevant
In using this machine flakes of meal are sent through wedge shaped cells of a cylindrical vessel.,Relevant
The solvent then passes through the matter to be collected at the bottom.,Relevant
Also still in use by a significant number of manufacturers is the Bollman or Hansa Muhle unit in which oilseed flakes are placed in perforated baskets that circulate continuously.,Relevant
The solvent percolates through the matter which is periodically dumped and replaced.,Relevant
Ninety percent of the solvent remaining in the extracted oil simply evaporates and as it does it is collected for reuse.,Relevant
The rest is retrieved with the use of a stripping column.,Relevant
The oil is boiled by steam and the lighter hexane floats upward.,Relevant
As it condenses it too is collected.,Relevant
The oil is next refined to remove color odor and bitterness.,Relevant
Refining consists of heating the oil to between 107 and 188 degrees Fahrenheit (40 and 85 degrees Celsius) and mixing an alkaline substance such as sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate with it.,Irrelevant
Soap forms from the undesired fatty acids and the alkaline additive and it is usually removed by centrifuge.,Relevant
The oil is further washed to remove traces of soap and then dried.,Relevant
Oils are also degummed at this time by treating them with water heated to between 188 and 206 degrees Fahrenheit (85 and 95 degrees Celsius) steam or water with acid.,Relevant
The gums most of which are phosphatides precipitate out and the dregs are removed by centrifuge.,Relevant
Oil that will be heated (for use in cooking) is then bleached by filtering it through fuller s earth activated carbon or activated clays that absorb certain pigmented material from the oil.,Relevant
By contrast oil that will undergo refrigeration (because it is intended for salad dressing for example) is winterized—rapidly chilled and filtered to remove waxes.,Relevant
This procedure ensures that the oil will not partially solidify in the refrigerator.,Irrelevant
Finally the oil is deodorized.,Relevant
In this process steam is passed over hot oil in a vacuum at between 440 and 485 degrees Fahrenheit (225 and 250 degrees Celsius) thus allowing the volatile taste and odor components to distill from the oil.,Relevant
Typically citric acid at . 01 percent is also added to oil after deodorization to inactivate trace metals that might promote oxidation within the oil and hence shorten its shelf life.,Relevant
The completely processed oil is then I V measured and poured into clean containers usually plastic bottles for domestic oils to be sold in supermarkets glass bottles for imports or domestic oils to be sold in specialty stores or cans for imports (usually olive oil).,Relevant
First tree trunks are stripped of bark and torn into small chips.,Relevant
Next these chips are placed in a large high pressure tank called a batch digester where they are cooked in a solution or liquor made of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and several other ionic compounds such as sulfates sulfides and sulfites.,Relevant
These strongly alkaline chemicals dissolve the lignin the glue like substance that holds the individual wood fibers together in a tree trunk.,Relevant
When the pressure is released after several hours the wood chips explode like popcorn into fluffy masses of fiber.,Relevant
After additional cleaning and refining steps a consistent slurry of wood pulp is pumped to the paper making machine also known as a Fourdrinier machine.,Relevant
Gigantic square structures up to 600 feet long (182.88 meters) these machines contain a wire mesh in which the paper is initially formed.,Relevant
Next the paper is fed into massive steam heated rollers and wide felt blankets that remove the water.,Relevant
At the end the finished medium or liner is rolled for shipment.,Relevant
Rolls of kraft paper for corrugating are available in many sizes to fit the production equipment at different corrugating plants.,Irrelevant
The most common roll sizes are 67 inches (170.18 centimeters) wide and 87 inches (220.98 centimeters) wide.,Irrelevant
An 87 inch roll of heavier paper can weigh up to 6 000 pounds (2 724 kilograms).,Irrelevant
As many as 22 rolls of 87 inch paper can be loaded into one railroad boxcar for shipment to a corrugating plant.,Irrelevant
At the plant the kraft paper is separated into different grades which will be used for the medium and the liner.,Relevant
These different grades of corrugated cardboard can be made by combining different grades of kraft paper.,Irrelevant
A knowledgeable packaging specialist works with a customer to determine the strength required for the corrugated cardboard container being planned.,Relevant
Then when a plant receives an order for containers a product engineer specifies the combination of medium and liner to produce a cardboard to match the customer s requirement.,Relevant
Using powerful fork lifts skilled equipment operators select move and load rolls of kraft paper at one end of the corrugator.,Relevant
Corrugated cardboard manufacture includes two key steps making kraft paper and corrugating the cardboard.,Relevant
Kraft paper involves pulping wood chips and then feeding the resulting paper substance through massive steam rollers that remove the water.,Relevant
Corrugating is also done in a machine that utilizes heavy rollers.,Relevant
One roll of cardboard is corrugated and then glued between two other layers (liners) by the same machine.,Relevant
The glue is then cured by passing the cardboard over heated rolls.,Relevant
One roll of medium is loaded to run through the corrugating rolls and a roll of liner is fed into the corrugator to be joined with the corrugated medium.,Relevant
Liner from another roll travels up over the corrugating rolls along a flat structure called the bridge.,Relevant
This liner will be glued to the corrugated medium later in the process.,Relevant
For a large production run additional rolls are loaded into automatic splicers.,Relevant
Sensitive detectors check the rolls of paper feeding into the corrugator.,Relevant
When a roll is nearly empty the corrugator control system starts a splicer and paper from the new roll is joined to the end of the paper going through the machine.,Relevant
Thus production of corrugated cardboard is continuous and no production speed is lost.,Irrelevant
The medium to be corrugated is fed into the giant electrically driven rollers of the corrugator first through the preheating rollers and then into the corrugating rolls.,Relevant
Steam at 175 to 180 pounds of pressure per square inch (psi) is forced through both sets of rollers and as the paper passes through them temperatures reach 350 to 365 degrees Fahrenheit (177 to 185 degrees Celsius).,Relevant
The corrugating rolls are covered with I O flutes —horizontal parallel ridges like the teeth of massively wide gears.,Relevant
When the hot paper passes between the corrugating rolls the flutes trap and bend it forming the middle part of a sheet of corrugated cardboard.,Relevant
Each corrugating machine has interchangeable corrugating rolls featuring different flute sizes.,Irrelevant
Installing a different A finished piece of corrugated cardboard consists of a single corrugated layer sandwiched between two liner layers.,Irrelevant
A finished piece of corrugated cardboard consists of a single corrugated layer sandwiched between two liner layers flute size in the corrugator changes the width of the corrugated medium.,Irrelevant
The medium travels next to a set of rollers called the single facer glue station.,Relevant
Here one layer of liner is glued to the medium.,Relevant
Starch glue is carefully applied to the corrugated edges of the medium and the first layer of liner is added.,Relevant
From the single facer the medium and liner go to the double backer glue station where the other layer of liner from the bridge is added following the same procedure.,Relevant
Continuing through the corrugator the cardboard passes over steam heated plates that cure the glue.,Relevant
At the end of corrugator a slitter scorer trims the cardboard and cuts it into large sheets called box blanks.,Relevant
Box blanks pop out of the slitter scorer like wide slices of toast and slide into an automatic stacker that loads them onto a large rolling platform.,Relevant
From here they will be transported to the other machines that will convert them into finished containers.,Relevant
Skilled production workers use a computer terminal and printer to prepare a job ticket for each stack of box blanks produced by the corrugator.,Relevant
With the job ticket workers can route the stack to the right fabrication machines called flexos (the name is short for flexographic machine).,Relevant
A flexo is a wide flat machine that processes box blanks.,Irrelevant
Printing dies and die cutting patterns I 3 are prepared in a pattern shop on large flexible sheets of rubber or tin.,Relevant
The dies and patterns are loaded onto the large rollers in the flexo and the box blanks are automatically fed through it.,Relevant
As each blank passes through the rollers of the flexo it is trimmed printed cut scored and in a printer folder gluer folded and glued to form a box.,Relevant
From the flexo the finished boxes are automatically stacked and sent to a banding machine to be wrapped for shipping.,Relevant
Other equipment in a corrugating plant includes stand alone die cutters die cutters with print stations and machines known as curtain coaters that apply a wax coating to fruit vegetable and meat containers.,Relevant
Box blanks requiring only simple one color printing and die cutting can be run through a stand alone die cutter print station and curtain coater to produce water or grease resistant containers.,Relevant
Production begins with rectangular flat blanks of stainless steel sterling silver or in the case of plated flatware an alloy.,Relevant
Large rolls are stamped in individual blanks which are flat pieces roughly the same shape as the piece to be produced.,Relevant
Through a series of rolling operations these blanks are graded or rolled to the correct thickness and shapes required by the manufacturer s flatware patterns.,Relevant
First the blanks are rolled crosswise from left to right right to left and lengthwise then trimmed to outline.,Relevant
Each spoon for instance must be thick at the base of the handle to resist bending.,Relevant
This gives graded pieces the right balance and a good feel in the hand.,Irrelevant
Each piece is now in the form of a cleanly finished shape in the rough dimension of the utensil.,Irrelevant
Between operations the blanks must pass through annealing ovens to soften the metal for further machine operations.,Relevant
The annealing done under great heat must be very accurately controlled so the final piece will be resistant to bending and to nicks and dents when in use.,Relevant
The last annealing is the most  important because the pieces must be just the right degree of hardness when they are embossed.,Irrelevant
Then the metal can be forced easily into all the tiny details in the dies and the ornamentation will be faithfully reproduced.,Relevant
The rolled blanks are placed in the cutout press by an operator to remove the excess metal and to fashion the shape of the piece.,Relevant
This process is similar to cutting shapes from rolled dough.,Irrelevant
The shape of the piece is cut out of the metal and the excess metal is remelted and transformed back into sheets of metal to be used again.,Relevant
This trimming must ensure an accurate fit of the pieces into the dies when the design is applied.,Irrelevant
The next step is the forming of the pattern.,Relevant
Each pattern has its own hardened steel dies—two dies for each piece one with the pattern for the front of the piece and the other with the pattern for the back of the piece.,Irrelevant
These are carefully set in the hammers by die setters.,Relevant
The operator quickly places a piece in place under the drop hammer which descends with a hydraulic pressure of 200 tons.,Relevant
(The bases of the drop hammers are bedded in 160 cubic yards of cement).,Irrelevant
The metal is squeezed into every tiny detail of the ornamentation in the die embossing the pattern on the piece.,Relevant
The blow of the hammer hardens the piece for use in the home.,Relevant
Surplus metal around the outline of the piece is then removed by clipping presses.,Relevant
Special steps are necessary for the creation of knives spoons forks and holloware pieces.,Irrelevant
To make the hollow handle for the knife after two strips of metal are formed to shape they are then soldered together buffed and polished until the seam is no longer visible.,Relevant
The blade and handle are permanently joined by means of a powerful cement which bonds with great strength and durability.,Relevant
With the spoon after the pattern has been embossed upon the front and back of the handle the next step is the forming of the bowl.,Irrelevant
The forming is done again under the same powerful drop hammers from accurate steel dies.,Relevant
Each bowl requires two hammer blows.,Relevant
Surplus metal around the outline of the spoon is removed by clipping presses.,Relevant
A small burr still remains to be removed at a later operation.,Irrelevant
The forming of fork tines is a similar process to that of the forming of the spoon s bowl but the operation takes place before the pattern is applied to the handle.,Irrelevant
After a fork is cut to outline it is pierced and tined the tines are pieced out and the small piece of metal that holds the tip of the tines together is removed in another operation after the pattern has been applied.,Relevant
For the silver plated pieces the electroplating process is an additional step.,Relevant
The pieces are first prepared by being buffed so that the edges are smooth and the surfaces are free from small holes.,Relevant
When the buffing is completed the pieces are given a thorough cleaning with as many as 12 different chemical solutions.,Relevant
Finally they undergo electrolysis in which a layer of silver is electrically deposited over the base metal.,Relevant
The knives forks and spoons are now 1 0J buffed then polished.,Relevant
Depending on the pattern special finishing processes can give silver plated and sterling silver pieces a bright mirror like finish a soft satiny glow or a brushed or florentine finish.,Relevant
First styrene is made by combining ethylene and benzene.,Relevant
Next the styrene is subjected to suspension polymerization and treated with a polymerization initiator which together convert it into polystyrene.,Relevant
Once a polymer chain of the desired length has formed technicians stop the reaction with terminating agents.,Relevant
The resulting polystyrene beads are then cleaned and anomalous beads filtered out.,Relevant
To make small cell EPF workers then melt add a blowing agent to and extrude the beads.,Relevant
To produce smooth skinned EPF they pre expand the beads dramatically reducing their density.,Relevant
Next they heat and expand them before allowing them to sit for 24 hours so that they can cool and harden.,Relevant
The beads are then fed into a mold of the desired shape.,Relevant
The basic unit of polystyrene is styrene which is the product of a two fold reaction.,Irrelevant
Ethylene and benzene in the presence of a catalyst such as aluminum chloride form ethylbenzene (C 8 H 8 ) which is then dehydrogenated (hydrogen is removed) at 1 112 1 202 degrees Fahrenheit (600 650 degrees Celsius) to form styrene (C 8 H 8 ).,Relevant
Polystyrene is formed from styrene through suspension polymerization a process by which tiny drops of the monomer (in this case styrene) are completely surrounded by water and a mucilaginous substance.,Relevant
Supporting and surrounding the styrene globules the suspension agent produces uniform droplets of polystyrene.,Relevant
Next a polymerization initiator is added to the droplets which are suspended by heat radiation of about 212 degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius).,Relevant
This results in free radicals a group of atoms particularly likely to react with others because they contain unpaired electrons which are available for molecular bonding.,Irrelevant
Free radicals then combine at randomly to form chains of polystyrene.,Relevant
Stopping the polymerization process is difficult.,Irrelevant
Terminators are introduced to the process to end it at the appropriate time.,Relevant
Though variable chain length must fall within a certain range because polystyrene with overly long chains won t melt readily and polystyrene with short chains will be brittle.,Irrelevant
After polymerization is complete the mixture—consisting of beads made up of polystyrene chains—is cooled.,Relevant
These beads are then washed out and dried.,Relevant
Uniform bead size is achieved by sorting the beads through meshes which filter out over and undersized beads.,Relevant
First the beads of polystyrene must be expanded to achieve the proper density.,Relevant
This process is known as pre expansion and involves heating the polystyrene either with steam (the most common method) or hot air (for high density foam such as that used for a coffee cup) the heating is carried out in a vessel holding anywhere from 50 to 500 gallons (189 to 1 892 liters).,Relevant
During pre expansion an agitator is used to keep the beads from fusing together.,Relevant
Since expanded beads are lighter than unexpanded beads they are forced to the top of the vessel s cavity and discharged.,Relevant
This process lowers the density of the beads to three percent of their original value and yields a smooth skinned closed cell EPF that is excellent for detailed molding.,Irrelevant
Next the pre expanded beads are usually aged for at least 24 hours in mesh storage silos.,Relevant
This allows air to diffuse into the beads cooling them and making them harder.,Irrelevant
After aging the beads are fed into a mold of the desired shape.,Relevant
Low pressure steam is then injected into and between the beads expanding them once more and fusing them together.,Relevant
The mold is then cooled either by circulating water through it or by spraying water on the outside.,Relevant
EPF is such a good insulator that it is hard to cool the mold down.,Irrelevant
Using small molds can reduce both the heating and cooling time and thereby speed up the process.,Irrelevant
This process yields EPF with small cell size that can be used to manufacture boards used for insulation.,Irrelevant
The beads are melted and a blowing agent is added.,Relevant
The molten polystyrene is then extruded into the proper shape under conditions of high temperature and pressure.,Relevant
EPF is usually cut with common wood I working tools which must be kept very sharp at all times to cut smoothly.,Relevant
It can also be bonded with adhesives that do not destroy it.,Relevant
Water based adhesives are good as are phenolics epoxies resorcinols and ureas.,Irrelevant
EPF is not resistant to weathering or  sunlight and it is flammable so generally coatings such as epoxy different kinds of paint and nonflammable substances are applied to the surface.,Irrelevant
The following procedure assumes the plastic lenses are being made at an optical laboratory.,Irrelevant
The optical laboratory technician inputs the optical prescription for a pair of plastic lenses in the laboratory s computer.,Relevant
The computer then provides a printout specifying more information necessary for producing the required prescription.,Relevant
Based on this information the technician selects the appropriate plastic lens blanks.,Relevant
Each blank is placed in a prescription tray along with the customer s eyeglass frames and the original work order.,Relevant
The prescription tray will remain with the technician throughout the production process.,Irrelevant
The plastic blanks have different curves already ground into the front of them therefore the technician must select the blank that corresponds to the optical prescription required for each lens.,Relevant
The rest of the optical prescription or power must be ground into the back of the lens.,Relevant
The technician places the lenses in a lensometer an instrument used to locate and mark the optical center —the point that should be centered over the customer s pupil—of the lens blanks.,Relevant
Next adhesive tape is affixed to the front of each blank to keep the front from being scratched during the blocking process.,Relevant
The technician then places one lens blank at a time in a blocker machine which contains a heated lead alloy that fuses the block to the front of the blank.,Relevant
The blocks are used to hold each lens in place during the grinding and polishing processes.,Relevant
Next the technician places each blank into a generator a grinding machine that is set for the optical prescription.,Relevant
The generator grinds the appropriate optical curves into the back of each lens.,Relevant
After this step the lenses must be fined or polished.,Relevant
The technician selects a metal lens lap —a mold corresponding to the required optical prescription of the lens and both lenses are placed in the fining machine with the back of each lens in the appropriate lap.,Relevant
The front of each lens is then polished in a series of fining operations.,Relevant
First each lens is rubbed against an abrasive fining pad made of soft sandpaper.,Relevant
 After a second fining pad made of a smooth plastic is placed over the original sandpaper pad the lens is polished again as the fining machine rotates the pads in a circular motion while water flows over the lenses.,Relevant
After the initial fining process is completed the two pads are peeled off and thrown away.,Relevant
Next the laps are removed from each lens and soaked in hot water for a few moments.,Relevant
The laps are then attached back on the lenses and placed in the fining machine where the third and final fining pad is attached.,Relevant
The fining machine rotates the pads in a circular motion while a polishing compound consisting of aluminum oxide water and polymers flows over the lenses.,Relevant
The lenses are removed from the fining machine and the block attached to each lens is gently detached with a small hammer.,Relevant
Then the tape is removed from each lens by hand.,Relevant
The laps are sterilized before they are used to hold other lenses.,Relevant
Each lens is marked L or R with a red grease pencil  indicating which is the left and right lens.,Relevant
After the lenses are again placed in the lensometer to check and mark the optical center and inspect the other curves necessary for the proper optical prescription a leap pad —a small round metal holder—is then affixed to the back of each lens.,Relevant
Next the technician selects the lens pattern that matches the shape of the eyeglass frames and inserts the pattern and the lenses into an edging machine.,Relevant
The machine grinds each lens to its proper shape and places a bevel around the edge of the lens so that the lens will fit the eyeglass frames.,Relevant
Water flows over the lens throughout this process.,Irrelevant
If the lenses require additional grinding the process is done by hand using a mounted power grinder.,Relevant
This step is necessary for lenses to be inserted in metal or rimless frames which require more precise bevels.,Irrelevant
Finally the lenses are dipped into the I desired treatment or tint container.,Relevant
After drying the eyeglass lenses are ready for insertion in the desired frames.,Relevant
The optical laboratory may send the lenses back to the optical outlet without the frames in which case the optical outlet will insert the lenses in the frames.,Relevant
The 18 gauge steel from which most components of a file cabinet are made is bought in large quantities.,Relevant
It can reach the factory in coils 11.8 to 15.7 inches (3 to 4 meter) wide or for larger components such as the walls of the file cabinet in sheets of several sizes 9.8 by 12 feet or 8 by 9.8 feet (3 by 3.66 meters or 2.44 by 3 meters).,Irrelevant
To make small components such as compressors a ribbon of steel from a coil is rolled onto a machine that cuts it with a die.,Relevant
To make shelves or dividers the coils are unrolled and stamped in a press.,Relevant
To make the sides top and bottom of the file cabinet the large sheets of steel are cut to size.,Relevant
Stronger portions of the cabinets such as gussets ribs and end panels are made simply by folding the steel one two or three times depending on how much strength is desired and pounding it to form thick layered parts.,Relevant
Two assembly lines one for large parts and the other for small parts are set up for painting.,Relevant
To produce a superb finish conventional  or more often epoxy paints are used in an electrostatic gun.,Relevant
This effective method disperses the paint in powdered form yielding only one percent waste.,Relevant
Electrostatic painting works best in a vacuum so a 23 inch (58 centimeter) area around the object to be painted is cleared.,Relevant
An aluminum wire runs from the paint gun to the cabinet in order to ground it.,Relevant
While the paint is given a positive charge the component to be painted receives a negative charge.,Relevant
The gun then sends the paint out through a small cupped head that rotates to cover all surfaces even those that are not flat evenly.,Relevant
After spraying the parts are heated to secure the paint.,Relevant
The strong bond that forms between the differently charged paint and part results in a durable finish.,Irrelevant
After being painted the top bottom and sides of the cabinet are welded together.,Relevant
The parts are held steady in a jig a device that resembles a vise.,Relevant
File cabinets are spot welded meaning that welds are made at regular intervals between two overlapping sheets of metal.,Relevant
During spot welding a low voltage high current power source with two electrodes one on each side of the joint is placed on a spot and pressure is applied.,Relevant
A current is generated between the two electrodes and the resistance of the metal to the current generates heat that bonds the two sheets together.,Relevant
This method is also known as electrical resistance welding.,Irrelevant
The slide mechanisms on which the drawers move are usually purchased from a specialty manufacturer and placed within holders that are bolted in place within the cabinet.,Relevant
The drawers are then assembled.,Relevant
Some components such as the latch or the card label holder are merely slipped into pre cut holes in the steel and clamped into place.,Relevant
Other parts such as the handle are bolted into place.,Relevant
Manufacture of the tank type or cylinder fire extinguisher requires several manufacturing operations to form the pressure vessel load the chemical agent machine the valve and add the hardware hose or nozzle.,Irrelevant
Pressure vessels are formed from puck shaped (disc) blocks of special aluminum alloy.,Relevant
The puck is first impact extruded on a large press under great pressure.,Relevant
In impact extrusion the aluminum block is put into a die and rammed at very high velocity with a metal tool.,Relevant
This tremendous energy liquifies the aluminum and causes it to flow into a cavity around the tool.,Relevant
The aluminum thus takes the form of an open ended cylinder with considerably more volume than the original puck.,Irrelevant
The necking process puts a dome on the open end of the cylinder by constricting In a typical gas cartridge extinguisher a spike pierces the gas cartridge.,Relevant
The released gas expands quickly to fill the space above the water and pressurize the vessel.,Relevant
The water can then be pumped out of the extinguisher with the necessary force.,Relevant
In a typical gas cartridge extinguisher a spike pierces the gas cartridge.,Relevant
The released gas expands quickly to fill the space above the water and pressurize the vessel.,Relevant
The water can then be pumped out of the extinguisher with the necessary force.,Relevant
Thie open end with another operation called spinning.,Irrelevant
Spinning gently rolls the metal together increasing the wall thickness and reducing the diameter.,Relevant
After spinning the threads are added.,Relevant
The vessel is hydrostatically tested cleaned and coated with a powdered paint.,Relevant
The vessel is then baked in an oven where the paint is cured.,Relevant
Next the extinguishing agent is added.,Relevant
If the vessel is a stored pressure type the vessel is then pressurized accordingly.,Relevant
If a gas cartridge is necessary to help expel the extinguishing agent it is also inserted at this time.,Relevant
After the extinguishing element is added the vessel is sealed and the valve is added.,Relevant
The valve consists of a machined body made of metal bar stock on a lathe or a plastic injected molded part on the economy versions.,Irrelevant
It must be leak free and it must have provisions for threading into the cylinder.,Irrelevant
The final manufacturing operation is the assembly of the actuating handle safety pins and the mounting bracket.,Relevant
These parts are usually cold formed—formed at low temperatures—steel or sheet metal forms purchased by the manufacturer from an outside vendor.,Irrelevant
Identification decals are also placed on the cylinder to identify the proper fire class rating as well as the suitability for recharging.,Relevant
Many of the economy versions are for one time use only and cannot be refilled.,Irrelevant
The manufacture of a floppy disk takes place in three phases.,Irrelevant
First the disk itself is made then the case is made and finally the two are assembled.,Relevant
The procedure for 8 and 5 1 4 inch disks differs slightly from that for the 3 1 2 inch model.,Irrelevant
First the recording media (Mylar) in the form of stock roll is coated with an extremely fine layer of iron oxide.,Relevant
The thickness of this layer depends on the size of the disk and the type of density.,Irrelevant
For instance the layer thickness is 110 microinches for 8 inch high density diskettes and 35 microinches for 3 1 2 inch high density disks.,Irrelevant
The coating for standard density diskettes is thicker than that for high density diskettes and is less coercive  meaning that it has less magnetic force.,Irrelevant
Next the coated film is slit and appropriate size disks are punched out with an automatic device similar to a cookie cutter.,Relevant
  Each disk is then burnished or polished according to the required specifications and standards 8 and 5 1 4 inch disks are now ready for insertion into jackets.,Relevant
For 3 1 2 inch disks a stainless steel hub is attached to the media with an adhesive ring 3 1 2 inch disks are now ready for insertion into their plastic cases.,Relevant
The jackets of the 8 inch and 5 1 4 inch disks are cut out of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) stock to appropriate size and the fabric liners laminated to them.,Relevant
Each jacket is then punched to appropriate hole and notch configuration.,Relevant
The drive spindle hole in the middle helps to center the disk in the disk drive.,Relevant
The index hole  when aligned with an index hole punched in the media permits the drive to locate the beginning of each segment of data.,Irrelevant
The long thin oval hole also called the head access hole  is used by the magnetic head to come in direct contact with the media.,Relevant
The write protect notch prevents data from mistakenly being recorded or erased.,Irrelevant
The relief notches keep the lower end of the head access hole from bending.,Irrelevant
After the apertures have been punched the jacket is folded three ways with only the top flap left open.,Relevant
The jackets are now ready for assembly.,Irrelevant
The case or shell of 3 1 2 inch disks is molded out of hard plastic.,Relevant
It has a rectangular head access slot.,Irrelevant
The lower shell of the case is assembled with the button the wiper tab the write protect tab and the fabric liner.,Relevant
The upper shell is affixed with upper fabric liner.,Relevant
The spring loaded shutter assembly is now attached and the two shells are connected at the top two corners.,Relevant
The cases are now ready for assembly.,Irrelevant
For 8 and 5 1 4 inch disks the media is inserted into the jacket through the top.,Relevant
Each disk then undergoes comprehensive electrical and mechanical testing and certification.,Relevant
After the top of the jacket which had been left open is folded disk assembly is complete.,Relevant
Each disk is then given a final visual inspection before being labeled and packaged for shipment.,Relevant
Assembly of 3 1 2 inch disks is very similar.,Irrelevant
First the prepared media is inserted into the shell and then the disk is tested and certified.,Relevant
The two shells are now welded at the bottom two corners and the assembly is complete.,Relevant
Each disk is given a final visual inspection and then labeled and packaged for shipment.,Relevant
In lode or vein deposits the gold is mixed with another mineral often quartz in a vein that has filled a split in the surrounding rocks.,Relevant
Gold is obtained from lode deposits by drilling blasting or shoveling the surrounding rock.,Irrelevant
Lode deposits often run deep underground.,Irrelevant
To mine underground miners dig shafts into the ground along the vein.,Relevant
Using picks and small explosives they then remove the gold ore from the surrounding rock.,Relevant
The gold ore is then gathered up and taken to a mill for refinement.,Relevant
Placer deposits contain large pieces of gold ore (nuggets) and grains of gold that have been washed downstream from a lode deposit and that are usually mixed with sand or gravel.,Irrelevant
The three main methods used to mine placer deposits are hydraulic mining dredging and power shoveling.,Irrelevant
All methods of placer deposit mining use gravity as the basic sorting force.,Irrelevant
In the first method a machine called a hydraulic giant uses a high pressure stream of water to knock the gold ore off of banks containing the ore.,Relevant
The gold ore is then washed down into sluices or troughs that have grooves to catch the gold.,Relevant
Dredging and power shoveling involve the same techniques but work with different size buckets or shovels.,Irrelevant
In dredging buckets on a conveyor line scoop sand gravel and gold ore from the bottom of streams.,Irrelevant
In power shoveling huge machines act like shovels and scoop up large quantities of gold bearing sand and gravel from stream beds.,Irrelevant
Hydraulic mining and dredging are outlawed in many countries because they are environmentally destructive to both land and streams.,Irrelevant
Once the gold ore has been mined it usually is washed and filtered at the mine as a preliminary refinement technique.,Relevant
It is then shipped to mills where it is first combined with water and ground into smaller chunks.,Relevant
The resulting mixture is then further ground in a ball mill—a rotating cylindrical vessel that uses steel balls to pulverize the ore.,Relevant
The gold is then separated from the ore using one of several methods.,Relevant
 Floatation involves the separation of gold from its ore by using certain chemicals and air.,Relevant
The finely ground ore is dumped into a solution  that contains a frothing agent (which causes the water to foam) a collecting agent (which bonds onto the gold forming an oily film that sticks to air bubbles) and a mixture of organic chemicals (which keep the other contaminants from also bonding to the air bubbles).,Relevant
The solution is then aerated—air bubbles are blown in—and the gold attaches to the air bubbles.,Relevant
The bubbles float to the top and the gold is skimmed off.,Relevant
Cyanidation also involves using chemicals to separate the gold from its contaminants.,Relevant
In this process the ground ore is placed in a tank containing a weak solution of cyanide.,Relevant
Next zinc is added to the tank causing a chemical reaction in which the end result is the precipitation (separation) of the gold from its ore.,Relevant
The gold precipitate is then separated from the cyanide solution in a filter press.,Relevant
A similar method is amalgamation  which uses the same process with different chemicals.,Irrelevant
First a solution carries the ground ore over plates covered with mercury.,Relevant
The mercury attracts the gold forming an alloy called an amalgam.,Relevant
 The amalgam is then heated causing the mercury to boil off as a gas and leaving behind the gold.,Relevant
The mercury is collected recycled and used again in the same process.,Relevant
The carbon in pulp method also uses cyanide but utilizes carbon instead of zinc to precipitate the gold.,Irrelevant
The first step is to mix the ground ore with water to form a pulp.,Relevant
Next cyanide is added to dissolve the gold and then carbon is added to bond with the gold.,Relevant
After the carbon particles are removed from the pulp they are placed in a hot caustic (corrosive) carbon solution which separates the gold from the carbon.,Relevant
If the gold is still not pure enough it can be smelted.,Irrelevant
 Smelting involves heating the gold with a chemical substance called flux.,Relevant
 The flux bonds with the contaminants and floats on top of the melted gold.,Irrelevant
The gold is then cooled and allowed to harden in molds and the flux contaminant mixture (slag) is hauled away as a solid waste.,Relevant
The floor and body panels are made of sheet steel aluminum or fiber glass.,Irrelevant
If sheet metal is used the metal is cut to size in a sheet metal shear a machine that cuts it with giant scissors.,Relevant
It is then fed into a roll forming machine which shapes the metal by passing it over contoured forming rolls.,Relevant
If fiber glass is the chosen material the floor and body panels are formed as one piece by inserting layers of resin coated fiber glass in a mold and allowing them to harden.,Relevant
Tubular steel which resembles square bicycle handlebars is cut to size and the edges beveled (cut at an angle of less than 90 degrees) to prepare them for welding.,Relevant
The cut beveled pieces are then placed in a welding fixture and the chassis or frame is arc welded.,Relevant
In this process an electric current is fed out of the welding torch through a metal wire that is shielded by a concurrently emitted inert gas (usually argon or helium).,Relevant
As the wire melts it joins the tubes to form the chassis.,Relevant
Next the floor is welded in place and the attaching hardware for the suspension motor and body are arc welded to the frame.,Relevant
At this point the chassis may need to be straightened to adjust for stresses introduced into the steel tubing during welding.,Relevant
Once it is straight the chassis and body panels are cleaned and painted with a rust preventive finish coating.,Relevant
Next the right and left side of the transaxle housing are fitted with bearings gears seals and axle housings.,Relevant
Because of the close fits required for the bearings and gears these parts must be manually installed with special assembly tools.,Relevant
For example a special gauge is used to determine the size of the spacer required under the pinion gear.,Irrelevant
These spacers are used to set preload (pressure between the gear faces) and backlash (spacing between the gear faces).,Relevant
Next the two mating surfaces of the transaxle housing are coated with an anaerobic sealant which hardens in the absence of air and bolted together.,Relevant
The axle shafts and bearings are then slid into the axle housings and locked in place.,Relevant
The transaxle access plate and gasket are positioned and bolted in place.,Relevant
Auto adjusting drum type mechanical brakes are then assembled to each end of the axle housings.,Relevant
The rear cover is snapped into the base plate.,Relevant
The transformer which adjusts the direct current provided by the battery into an alternating current that is easier for the motor to use is then bolted to the base plate.,Relevant
Next the electric cable with plug thermal switch and DC Ammeter (used to measure the battery s direct current output) are wired in and attached.,Relevant
Finally the wrap around and face cover are bolted in place.,Relevant
The transaxle subassembly and the welded chassis are placed on a stand that is just the right height to allow the assembly personal to work in a upright position with a minimum of bending.,Relevant
The shock absorbers—oil filled cylinders that cushion the ride by displacing the oil when a bump is hit—are the first components bolted to the chassis one at each wheel location.,Relevant
Next the springs are bolted to the chassis with multiple leaf springs at the front axles and coil springs at the rear.,Relevant
The transaxle and the chassis are joined together by pinning the shock absorbers to the transaxle.,Relevant
Prior to assembly the coil springs must be compressed using a special fixture.,Relevant
The front axle bar may now be attached to the chassis by bolting the multiple leaf springs to the front axle bar from the chassis.,Relevant
The front axle shafts are then bolted to each end of the front axle bar.,Relevant
To insure smooth movement the wheel bearings are packed meaning that grease is forced into the bearing until it comes out the other side.,Relevant
The wheel plate with studs is then installed.,Relevant
The rack and pinion steering assembly is now bolted to the chassis and attached to the front axle shafts.,Relevant
The steering wheel and steering wheel shaft are then attached to the chassis and rack and pinion steering assembly.,Relevant
Next the body panels are bolted to the chassis and then the motor is installed.,Relevant
If the cart is to be electric powered a 36 volt direct current electric motor is bolted to the transaxle.,Relevant
If the cart is to be gasoline powered an eight horsepower gasoline engine is bolted to the chassis.,Relevant
The continuously variable (CV) transmission is also bolted to the chassis.,Relevant
Belts are then installed to the drive pulleys of the engine CV transmission and transaxle.,Relevant
The brake pedal is installed.,Relevant
Brake cables are routed and attached to the pedal and rear brakes.,Relevant
The accelerator pedal is installed and the accelerator cable is attached to the pedal and the engine.,Relevant
Next the electrical cables are routed and attached to the chassis.,Relevant
The headlights stoplights and on off key lock are installed and cables connected.,Relevant
Next the battery rack is bolted in and the batteries installed six six volt batteries for the electric drive vehicle or one twelve volt battery for the gasoline engine vehicle.,Relevant
A six gallon fuel tank is then installed in the gasoline engine vehicle and a hose routed from the tank to the engine.,Relevant
The batteries are connected and the fuel tank filled.,Relevant
The seat cushions are installed and if ordered the canopy top windshield and storage baskets are attached.,Relevant
For delivery in North America there are no packaging requirements.,Irrelevant
Delivery is normally by truck.,Irrelevant
After being driven onto the truck the golf carts have their fuel drained their batteries disconnected and their wheels blocked in place.,Relevant
Overseas shipments require that the golf cart be placed on a skid—a heavy wood or steel rack—to discourage shifting in transit.,Relevant
