Sentence,Class
The process begins when someone is declaring a damage for which he wants to be compensated,Relevant
"For that; he has several ways to state the incident,Irrelevant"
The choice will impact the way the clerk will address the issue,Irrelevant
The claim management officer will firstly check if the person declaring is an actual client of Ethias,Relevant
"For the application or the website channel; this check will be done by the person itself,Relevant"
"Obviously; the victim must be a client of Ethias in order to be compensated; if not; the process ends here by informing the victim the steps that he should follow in order to be eligible for the coverage,Relevant"
"In some cases; when the incident is claimed by phone; the clerk starts by asking the victim if he or she needs some support such as a tow truck for instance,Relevant"
Then the victim will share key information with the officer of the claims management department to make the declaration,Relevant
"Whether it is by phone or by mail; the information is transcribed into the IT system,Relevant"
"If the declaration is done via the form in the application or website of Ethias; the information ends up directly in the IT system,Relevant"
"After that; the case is opened for the client and the process may continue with the case instruction and examination to see if it meets the conditions to compensate the victim,Relevant"
"To this end; the clerk will assess if there is a matter of liability in the case or not; as well as checking if the client contract covers the damage that occurred and assessing the level of damage by means of experts or by his experience,Relevant"
"At the same time; the case handler decides which type of reservation the case should follow,Relevant"
"In the perspective of an actuarial reservation; he informs the actuarial department by sending the case to it,Relevant"
"In the other perspective; the clerk defines the amount to reserve by himself and sends it to the actuarial department to be approved,Relevant"
"The case handler sees if the coverage conditions are fulfilled; that is to say that for cases of engaged liabilities the client should be considered liable; otherwise it’s not up to his insurance to compensate,Relevant"
The other condition is that the contract should cover the damage,Relevant
"In the end; a notification with the outcome will be sent to the client and if these conditions are well fulfilled; Ethias will compensate for the damage,Relevant"
The case is finally settled or unsettled,Relevant
"In order to understand the reservation process better; it is necessary to clarify its purpose in the context of an insurance company: reservation allows Ethias to deal with future compensation needs by means of statistical computation techniques ; for example; someone broke his leg this year and because of that; he might have complications like a need for a surgery years later,Relevant"
"Then; his insurance will have to compensate him once again,Relevant"
"That’s why; on the insurance side; they have to make a reservation in order to be prepared for these cases,Irrelevant"
"As seen in the claims management process; the clerk decides which type of reservation is needed based on his evaluation,Relevant"
"Actuarial reservation only deals with cases considered as recurrent and with a higher level of generality; also; they are most of the time short term cases,Irrelevant"
"Otherwise; the clerk determines and evaluates by himself the amount to reserve but still sends it to the actuarial department for approbation,Relevant"
"So for this process; when the claim management officer informs the actuary that the case needs an actuarial reservation; the latter collects all the data regarding the case by means of a database,Relevant"
Then he analyzes it in order to fix new hypotheses which will be used for computation,Relevant
This computation is handled by a mathematical program,Relevant
"Nevertheless; to find which model to use; the actuary follows precise guidelines and rules,Irrelevant"
The outcome of this computation will be checked by the actuarial control 4,Relevant
"If changes are needed; the actuary will adjust his model and repeat the computation,Relevant"
"After the approbation by the actuarial control; the assessment of the case is sent to the accounting department in order to be accounted for,Relevant"
It’s up to the actuary to communicate the reservation to the accounting department,Relevant
"To initiate this process; a product manager from the marketing or sales department requests to price a product,Relevant"
Then the actuary team of the tarification department will gather data and statistics about the type of incidence that the service covers,Relevant
The Ethias database is filled with information in order to develop a technical model of tarification to take into account the specific risks and give a first price for the premium,Relevant
"But this price does not always comply with the market demand and customer needs; this is the reason why the actuary team and the product manager exchange information to compute a model more suitable for the market,Relevant"
This second version of the model will be sent to the actuarial control in order to be reviewed and to check the perspective of profitability with the business plan,Relevant
"When the review is done; if changes are needed the actuary team takes care of remodelling it and shows the model to the actuarial control once again until it’s validated by it,Relevant"
This validation must be followed by the agreement of all the stakeholders that are linked with this pricing process,Relevant
Their agreement is necessary before establishing the tariff and sending it to the product manager,Irrelevant
The underwriting process begins when a demand for insurance coverage is perceived by the sales department,Relevant
"This demand is sent either by a peer-to-peer procedure between Ethias and the organisation; by a broker as an intermediate of the concerned company or by a tendering procedure on public markets,Relevant"
"This distinction doesn’t change the process in essence; but rather in the outcomes and the channel of communication,Irrelevant"
"Then the demand is transferred into the CRM system of Ethias either by the sales officer or; in some cases; automatically,Relevant"
"Next; the sales officer checks if this demand comply with the business guidelines of Ethias in strategic or relationship terms,Relevant"
"Generally; the case complies and continues its path towards the underwriting department to follow two successive analysis procedures: first; an acceptance analysis which is made in order to make the decision to keep such demand or to reject it,Relevant"
"If the underwriter doesn’t accept it then the process ends; otherwise he proceeds; in a second time; to a tarification analysis,Relevant"
These two phases are modelled as subprocesses which consist of multiple tasks that should be done before setting the tariff and the offer,Relevant
"In addition; a competence scheme helps to decide whether the offer needs to be agreed by two other third parties; BOL and HAC; or not; depending on the offer,Irrelevant"
They can eventually ask for adjustment before pursuing the process,Relevant
"Later on; if the third parties agreed when needed; the underwriter decides the channel through which he will make the offer,Relevant"
"Considering the circumstances; he has 3 possibilities: the offer could either be led directly towards the client through the CRM system; be led to an account manager (ACMA) that will defend the offer in front of the call for tenders or be placed in a share application for the sales department that will handle it from there,Relevant"
The outcome of the offer will be communicated through the same channel used to make the offer,Relevant
"The last tasks for the underwriter are to settle all the paperwork and then; depending on the outcome; to classify the case or not: if the outcome is negative; he must do so; if it is positive; the onus is not on him to do that and the process is over,Relevant"
This process begins when a client requests insurance coverage,Relevant
He has the choice to fill in the subscription form digitally or to have contact with a clerk in an agency or via phone call,Relevant
The sales officer of the front office will define what services the customer needs and check if he is already a client in Ethias,Relevant
"If it’s not the case; the clerk affiliates him by asking for personal information,Relevant"
"Then the officer will check the client's incident data in DataSure; which is a database to centralise all the declared incidences from any insurance company; in order to decide if he is eligible for the services needed,Relevant"
"If he is not eligible; the rejection is communicated directly after this verification,Relevant"
"Either way; the clerk makes the first quotation with the information gathered and hands in to the client or sends it via letter or email if the request is made via phone call,Relevant"
"The client reviews it; fills it with extra information needed to establish any contracts and sends it back via the channel of his choice,Relevant"
"If it is physically; then the clerk decides if it meets the criteria of acceptance by analysing the risk,Relevant"
The rejection is also communicated to the client after this verification,Relevant
"If accepted; the clerk makes changes if needed by taking into account the review of the client and the extra information,Relevant"
Then the contract is printed and given to the client and waited to be signed,Relevant
"If it is digitally; the back office takes care of making the verification with the criteria and establishing the contract by taking into account all the data,Relevant"
All this procedure is simplified if the client firstly decides to fill the subscription digitally,Relevant
"For that;he needs to be affiliated and this is made possible thanks to the website or the application,Irrelevant"
The subscription form and client’s data are sent directly to the back office to be evaluated and analysed,Relevant
The officer checks with the criteria of acceptance and decides whether to send a rejection or to establish and send the contract to be signed by the client,Relevant
The process starts when an employee is sick or absent for whatever reason,Relevant
"The first step of the process has to be done by the employee: he has to send his medical certificate to the human resources and at the ""same time""; he has to contact them in order to inform them of the duration of its absence,Relevant"
"Thanks to this; the human resources can start their own process in which they try to replace him by someone,Relevant"
"Then; after both of these tasks have been completed; the next tasks will mainly concern the human resources department,Relevant"
"They have to sort out the different types of medical certificates; check if they are certificates without pathologies or certificates with pathologies,Relevant"
"On the one hand; if and only if the certificate is without any pathology; the human resources employee has to check it and verify if the certificate is valid,Relevant"
"Then; he has to verify some little things like the start of the absence; the end of it; and then he has to send a mail to SPCM to prevent them,Relevant"
"Following this; at the same time; he has to encode this absence in the system in order that all the organization can be aware of the absence of the employee and he has to notify the medical advisor too; and then the medical advisor will have to choose whether the veracity of this absence must be checked or not,Relevant"
"On the other hand; if and only if this certificate contains pathologies; the human resources employee has to send it directly to the “Service Provincial de contrôle médical” and has to fulfill a form,Relevant"
"After that; the SPCM checks if the certificate is correct and if there is any problem,Relevant"
"After that; he then gives his accord to the organization to encode this,Relevant"
"So; the human resources employee can encode this in the database,Relevant"
"Afterwards; at the same time; they have to notify the medical advisor; and then the medical advisor chooses to check the veracity of this absence or not; and; the human resources employee can check the date; the absence; etc,Relevant"
"After that; in addition they receive the acknowledgement of receipt and finally they can put the certificate in the HR certificate folder and the process is over,Relevant"
The process starts at the end of the month when it is time to pay the different employees in the company,Relevant
We should note that almost the entire process is carried out by human resources,Irrelevant
"Firstly; at the same time; the human resources employee is doing 4 different tasks; which are: check for extra hours; check leaving request; check attendance system in order to know how many hours the employee worked and then check it with the system “Unitime,Relevant"
"” Finally; he checks sickness; so if an employee was absent and then uses HR Accent in order to verify this,Relevant"
"When all these 4 steps are finally done; he writes a recap' with all the information so he can export them to Securex,Relevant"
Securex checks the feedback and sends it to the human resources,Relevant
"After receiving the feedback from Securex; the human resources employee treats the document in order to make a proposal for the salary,Relevant"
"After receiving the proposition; there is a question within the HR; “are we agree with this proposition? “If no; the process restarted at the proposition of wage slip,Relevant"
"If the response is yes; we can continue the process,Relevant"
Human resources can then send the payment permission to Securex and wait until the reception of Securex agreement,Relevant
"Subsequently; several things have to be done at the same time; we are going to describe them branch by branch,Irrelevant"
"Firstly; in the first branch he receives the “décompte de paye” and then prints it in order to send the file to the employee,Relevant"
"Afterwards; there is a question: ""Is there any contestation?"" If there is no contestation; we can continue and finalize the process with the acceptation of Securex payment,Relevant"
"But; if there is a contestation; we have to ask the CEO what to do with it and then a new process starts,Relevant"
"Finally; on the other branch; things that need to be done first are to ask Securex to prepare the invoice; then we are waiting until Securex creates it; and sends it,Relevant"
"After this; there is another question: ""Are we sending this to accounting or not?"" If the answer is ""yes""; we can accept Securex's payment and the process ends,Relevant"
"And if no; once again we have to ask the CEO what to do,Relevant"
This process starts when an application is sent by a candidate to the HR which do a first sorting and then a second one,Relevant
"After this; the first interview take place,Relevant"
"Then we are in the first question which is “Is this a key position or not?” If yes; we need to know if we need complementary assessments: - if yes; a specialist office makes a couple of tests and then sends the results to the HR,Relevant"
"After this; we conclude whether it is okay or not,Relevant"
"If it is not; we can dismiss the application and inform the applicant of that,Relevant"
We therefore destroy these data,Relevant
"But if it is okay; we arrive to the second interview which is important,Relevant"
#NAME?
"So; at this moment; we are at the same point,Irrelevant"
"After the interview; there is a selection; if the candidate is not selected; then we can dismiss the application and inform the applicant of that; and destroy its data,Relevant"
"But if the candidate is selected; then HR sends a notification to the applicant and welcomes him as a new worker,Relevant"
"If it is not a key post; we are directly in the step of selection,Relevant"
"So; if the candidate is not selected; then we can dismiss the application and inform the applicant of that; and destroy its data,Relevant"
"But if the candidate is selected; then HR sends a notification to the applicant and welcomes him as a new worker,Relevant"
The process starts when the financial department picks up an invoice in order to pay it,Relevant
It should be noted that the file in question is recuperated in the ISABEL system,Relevant
"Firstly; the financial department employee prints the details of payment,Relevant"
"After this; he shows the file to the financial director,Relevant"
"Afterwards; he needs to classify the invoices according to whether they are above 150;000 euros or under 150;000 euros,Relevant"
"- When we are under 150;000; the financial employee just has to inform the HR department,Relevant"
"- When we are above 150;000; he has to ask the financial director to find out if it is okay,Relevant"
"After these steps; we follow the same path in both cases; and the process stays located in the financial and accounting department,Relevant"
"Then; the employee verifies the liquidity on the account in order to know if there are no problems with the treasury,Relevant"
"After that; he can send money to the bank account; send an email to CBC bank with the details of payment and finally register the payment in the SAP system; before ending with the receiving of the account statement,Relevant"
This process starts when a client asks for an intervention,Relevant
This request is directly registered in a file,Relevant
"Then; it must be checked if the intervention is included in the contract,Relevant"
#NAME?
"But if he agrees; the organization can define the costs of the intervention,Relevant"
#NAME?
"After this; at that moment we are on the same track; it should be chosen if we need an internal quote or an external one,Relevant"
"We then arrive to 2 different questions: The first one is: “Do we need an accord regarding the quote? “: - If the answer is ""yes""; the approbation of the client has to be asked,Relevant"
"If his answer is that it is okay; he must be informed about the start of the intervention,Relevant"
Then the intervention is finished,Relevant
"But if he refuses the quote; the process ends again,Relevant"
"- If the answer is ""no""; the client must be informed about the start of the intervention and also when it will be finished,Relevant"
The process starts when a customer makes a request to open/close the P1/S1 port (these are ports on the smart meter that allow the customer to connect their application on which they can consult their energy consumption in real time),Relevant
"The call is received by an interlocutor (called Connexio; working for a defined network distribution manager; in our case for ORES obviously),Relevant"
The Connexio will then control whether the customer is addressing the correct DNM using an identification database,Relevant
"If it is the wrong DNM; the Connexio informs the customer and the call ends,Relevant"
"Once the DNM check has been carried out; he will proceed to a process check,Relevant"
"If it is a High Voltage process; the customer is redirected to another service; otherwise if the process is Low Voltage; the Connexio identifies the requester thanks to the database of municipalities and social housing then controls the verbal offer,Relevant"
"If it is not a verbal offer; the request is transferred to the ""Connection Work"" process,Relevant"
"If it is a verbal offer; the process continues and the Connexio controls the file,Relevant"
"If the file is existing; he informs the client and the process ends; otherwise; he communicates the price of the service to the customer and reads the GDPR disclaimer in case of an opening; then waits for the client’s response,Relevant"
"If the client accepts; a file is created,Relevant"
Otherwise the file is immediately closed and the process ends,Relevant
"After having created the file; the Connexio asks if the client is able to receive a remote operation: if he is not able; he asks whether the preparatory work is the client’s responsibility,Relevant"
"If he is able; is the client's request unique? If the client's request is not unique; he asks if the preparatory work is the client's responsibility; otherwise he asks directly what type of appointment to make,Relevant"
"Concerning the preparatory work; if they are not the client’s responsibility; then the Connexio asks what type of appointment to make,Relevant"
"But if they are the responsibility of the customer; the Connexio informs the customer about the preparatory work; he waits for a response: if the customer does not accept; the file is closed and the process ends,Relevant"
If he accepts then he also asks what type of appointment to make,Relevant
"There are two types of appointments: The first one is if remote operations work (from June 2020); the Connexio sends confirmation to the customer but also to the control room that the thing has been taken into account,Relevant"
The control room receives this remote operation request for opening / closing port P1 / S1 and the process is terminated,Relevant
"The second one is if the technician has to come to the customer’s house: the Connexio controls the duration of the intervention; he schedules an appointment (if the intervention cannot be scheduled; the Connexio records the non-schedulable intervention request and the call ends),Relevant"
"After scheduling the appointment; he sends the appointment confirmation to the client; waits for the appointment confirmation,Relevant"
"After receipt; he sends the work order to the technician,Relevant"
The technician receives the file and the process ends,Relevant
The process is separated in 2 lanes: fieldworker and Work control OSP,Irrelevant
The process starts with the reception of a request to install a smart meter for the activation of prepayment mode,Relevant
All the processes arrive at the same gateway so I will describe each process up to the point of intersection and then explain what happens after,Relevant
1) The customer was present and another customer was present,Relevant
"If the customer wants a recovery; they process it to a recovery form,Relevant"
If the customer doesn’t want a recovery then they see if it is their first visit (a) 2) Another customer was not present and the customer accepts the installation,Relevant
(b)They check the communication network coverage,Relevant
If the communication network coverage is adequate they check for fraud,Relevant
If there is a suspected fraud they send the information to the fraud department and they wait for the attention return from the fraud service which sends an end signal to fraud management,Relevant
(c) After that (whether there is fraud or not) if there is not a smart technical impossibility they replace the meter with a smart meter,Relevant
If there is a smart technical impossibility and an electromechanical technical impossibility they send the information of non-execution of the installation for technical impossibility,Relevant
If there is not an electromechanical technical impossibility they put a budget meter and activate prepayment mode,Relevant
"If the communication network coverage is not adequate and there is a possibility for deporting the antenna; they move the antenna to another area covered by the network and follow (c),Relevant"
If there is no possibility for deporting the antenna they check the electromechanical technical possibility (such as in c),Relevant
Another customer was not present and the customer does not accept the installation,Relevant
If the client is electro-sensitive then the process goes directly to the checking of the electromechanics technical impossibility (in the c),Relevant
If the client is not electro-sensitive and it is their (a) first visit the process goes directly to the point of intersection,Relevant
If it is not their (a) first visit but it is their second visit and the meter installation is possible before shutdown then the process continues to point (b),Relevant
"If the meter installation is not possible before shutdown and a meter cut is possible; 2 things happen simultaneously,Relevant"
The first is checking if the meter installation is possible: if yes it goes to (b) if not it goes to the point of intersection,Relevant
The second is to send the cutout start execution request to the meter and then wait for the message of the smart meter cut back,Relevant
If there is no cancellation request they perform the cut on the meter,Relevant
(d) After that an effective cutoff confirmation is filed which sends a message to the customer then they send the effective cutoff information which lead to the intersection point and (e) in the Work control OSP lane receiving information on the execution of cuts which send an end signal of management of cut returns,Relevant
(f) If there is a cancellation request the process goes to the intersection point,Relevant
If a meter cut is not possible (g) they check the possibility of a network cut,Relevant
If a network cut is possible they send the request to start the execution of the network cut then wait for the message to start network cut back,Relevant
If there is a cancellation request the process arrives at (f) and if not they execute the cut network then follow (d),Relevant
If a network cut is not possible they send the non-cut information which simultaneously lead the process to the intersection point and in (h) the work control OSP lane receive the information about non-execution of cuts which send an end signal of post-administration,Relevant
3) The customer was not present and it is the first visit,Relevant
If the meter is not accessible the process goes directly to the intersection point,Relevant
"If the meter was accessible; they check the communication network coverage,Relevant"
(i) If the communication network coverage is adequate they check for fraud,Relevant
If there is a suspected fraud they send the information to the fraud department and wait for the attention return from the fraud service which sends an end signal to fraud management,Relevant
(j) After that (whether there is fraud or not) if there is not a smart technical impossibility the meter is replaced with a smart meter and the process goes to the intersection,Relevant
If there is a smart technical impossibility and an electromechanical technical impossibility the information is sent of non-execution of the installation for technical impossibility,Relevant
If there is not an electromechanical technical impossibility they put an electromechanics budget meter and activate prepayment mode,Relevant
"If the communication network coverage is not adequate and there is a possibility for deporting the antenna; the antenna is moved to another area covered by the network and follow (j),Relevant"
If there is no possibility for deporting the antenna they check the electrical technical possibility (such as in j),Relevant
4) The customer was not present and it is not the first visit,Relevant
If it is their second visit and a meter installation is possible before shutdown they follow (i),Relevant
"If it is not their second visit or it is their second visit but the meter installation is not possible before shutdown; they check if a network cut is possible,Relevant"
"If yes; they send a request to start execution of the network cut and wait for a message of network cut back,Relevant"
"If there is a cancellation request the process goes to the intersection point and if not; they cut the installation; file an effective cutoff notice which sends a message to the customer and send confirmation of effective shutdown which leads the process to the intersection point and in the work control OSP lane; following (e),Relevant"
"If the network cut is not possible the information is sent of the non-execution of the cut which lead the process to the intersection point and in the work control OSP lane; following (h),Relevant"
"All of these lead to one gateway; after that they complete the worksheet,Relevant"
"If the client is present; they sign the worksheet and if they are not a calling card is left for the customer which sends a message to them,Relevant"
Both of them lead to saving the worksheet and ending the process in the Work control OSP lane with post-administration,Relevant
"This process is divided into 5 lanes: planned works; technical solution officer; supervisor; manager and CTM coordinator,Irrelevant"
The process starts at planned works when an appointment's planning is needed,Relevant
First thing is to know if it is a grid/construction work or not,Relevant
"If it is not a grid/construction work; planned works assess if it is a civil engineering operation,Relevant"
"If it is a civil engineering operation; they find out if there is an authorization or an information request (a),Relevant"
"If it is not a civil engineering operation; is it an individual planning? (b) If it is a grid/construction work that is needed; the file is sent to the technical solution officer,Relevant"
(1) Planned works wait for the period defined in the order then check if there is a request for authorization or information,Relevant
"(a) If it is an information request; planned works show the levelling zone and encodings to Powalco and then check KLIM and CICC and the process goes on,Relevant"
"If it is an authorization request; they check if the authorization has been received,Relevant"
"If it has been received; the process goes on; if it hasn't; planned works contact the competent authorities again to receive the authorization; then the process goes on,Relevant"
Planned works then figure out if there's a presence of KLIM/CICC,Relevant
"If there is; the file is sent to the CTM coordinator (2) and planned works wait for the CTM coordinator's feedback,Relevant"
"When the feedback is received; the process goes on,Relevant"
"(*) If there is not a presence of KLIM/CICC; planned works find out if it is an individual planning,Relevant"
"(b) If it is an individual planning; the process goes on,Relevant"
"If it is not an individual planning; they form the batches; transmit a list to the contractor and inform the client and the process goes on,Relevant"
"(c) (*) Planned works then contact the client to arrange an appointment; they make the client aware of the preparatory work and then plan the appointment with them,Relevant"
They send a confirmation email to the client,Relevant
"If the reply received is negative; planned works contact the client again,Relevant"
"(c) If the reply is positive; planned works assess if the work is planned on a contractor,Relevant"
"If it is; planned works prepare the file that will be sent to the contractor and send it to him,Relevant"
"Then the process is done and a signal is sent to the process ""Execute the work"",Relevant"
"If it is not; the file is sent to a technician and planned works assess if it is a civil engineering operation,Relevant"
"If it is not a civil engineering operation; the process is done and a signal is sent to the process ""Execute the work"",Relevant"
"If it is a civil engineering operation; planned works send the file to the contractor to carry out civil engineering,Relevant"
"The process is then done and a signal is sent to the process ""Execute the work"",Relevant"
"(1) When the technical solution officer gets the file; they get back the file's investment/cronos and check the CTM,Relevant"
"If there is a CTM file; it is sent to the CTM coordinator (2) and the process goes on,Relevant"
"If there is not a CTM file; the process goes on,Relevant"
"The technical solution officer adjusts the file; (d) asks for authorization; inform planned works of the theoretical period (*),Relevant"
The officer finally transfers the file to the supervisor and his part is over,Relevant
"When the supervisor gets the file; he checks if the authorization is received,Relevant"
"If it is not received; the process goes back to the officer,Relevant"
"(d) If it is received; the supervisor executes the construction work; foresees the end of the work and informs the manager; which gets the info; then sends the file to the manager and the process is done,Relevant"
"The manager gets the file; foresees the end of the work; executes the operation work; informs planned works of the end of the works (*) and then the operation work is done,Relevant"
"(2) The CTM coordinator gets the file; contacts the other recipients; visits the work site; creates a report and sends the feedback to planned works,Relevant"
He then informs the technician and the contractor and the CTM is managed,Relevant
"The two main ORES services involved in the work execution process are the ""planned works"" department and the executing agent working in parallel,Irrelevant"
"Three other ORES actors play a lighter role; namely the 'design office'; 'supervision' and 'local logistics manager',Irrelevant"
Executing agent: The process starts with the receipt of the file,Relevant
Then either civil engineering works are required or not,Relevant
"If they are required; the agent plans them; informs the ""planned works"" of the civil engineering opening date (1); then carries out the inventory of fixtures; executes the earthworks and finally confirms the execution of the earthworks to the ""planned works"" (2),Relevant"
"Otherwise; nothing happens,Relevant"
"After that; the executing agent tries to reach the client 15 minutes before his departure and then goes to his home,Relevant"
"If the client can be reached and is present; he carries out the inventory of fixtures,Relevant"
"If the client is not present at first; the agent tries to reach him but if he is still unreachable; the executing agent then leaves a calling card; calls the BOPW; encodes the mobile data and finally signs the report,Relevant"
The Process ends in the management of the nonexecuted,Relevant
"After the inventory of fixtures; the agent checks whether additional work at the client's request is necessary; if not he can directly check the certificate of conformity,Relevant"
"If any work is required; the agent looks whether he needs BOPW information,Relevant"
"If so; he will request it and wait for confirmation,Relevant"
"In case of refusal; he checks the certificate of conformity,Relevant"
"In case of confirmation or if BOPW information is not required; he informs the customer of the costs; asks for his agreement; carries out the work and finally checks the certificate of conformity,Relevant"
"After checking the certificate of conformity; he checks the power and then jointly measures the column and replaces the meter and the parameter,Relevant"
"In the event of a problem at the time of replacement or parameter setting; the agent informs the local logistics manager (3); if the problem concerns only one meter the operation is repeated; otherwise an electromechanical meter is installed; then the customer is informed and the agent answers any questions in the same way as if the parameter setting was carried out correctly,Relevant"
"After that; if the LED confirms the functionality,Relevant"
"Then the meter is switched on; otherwise it is left switched off,Relevant"
"Then; he draws up an inspection plan which he sends to the Ores drawing office (4); enters the connection and counting data; confirms the materials used; draws up the output inventory and has the customer sign the report,Relevant"
"If civil works are required; the agent plans the closure of the civil works; informs the ""planned works"" of the closure date (5); plugs up the holes; repairs in a definitive manner; makes the inventory of fixtures and finally confirms the completion of the repair to the ""planned works"" (6),Relevant"
"Finally; his last task is to encode the internal services in the case of internal services or to encode the internal services in the case of entrepreneurial work,Relevant"
The process ends by sending the file to the post administration,Relevant
Planned work: The process begins with the planning of the worksite,Relevant
"Then; if civil engineering works are required; the ""planned works"" department receives the civil engineering opening date from the executing agent (1); the department then sends the civil engineering dates to the client; waits and finally receives confirmation of the earthworks by the executing agent (2),Relevant"
"If no civil engineering works are required; the ""planned works"" department informs the client by sms of the date of the works 48 hours in advance,Relevant"
The department then receives the execution information,Relevant
"If the execution is not carried out; the process ends and the ""prepare for execution"" process begins,Relevant"
"If it has been carried out; there is a waiting period,Relevant"
"Finally; again if civil works are required; the ""planned works"" department receives the civil works closing date from the executing agent (5); the department then sends the civil works closing dates to the client; waits; receives the confirmation of the civil works closing from the executing agent (6) and finally updates the data in the POWALCO software,Relevant"
"If there is no civil engineering; nothing happens,Relevant"
The process is then completed towards post-administration,Relevant
The drawing office: The process starts with the reception of the plan from the executing agent (4) and is then completed towards post-administration,Relevant
"Monitoring The process starts with the reception of the date of the works; then the service ensures the supervision of the building sites and the process is finished with supervised building sites,Relevant"
"Local logistics manager: The process starts with the reception of the message from the executing agent (3); then he processes the request and the process ends,Relevant"
The process starts at planned works when a technical visit is needed,Relevant
"If a visit without appointment (V1) is needed; planned works transfer the request to a technician and waits for feedback with the info concerning the V1,Relevant"
"While planned work is waiting; a technician gets the request; carries out the visit and transfers info to planned works before being done with V1,Relevant"
"When planned works get the V1 info; they can move on and prepare a file for a technical visit (V2),Relevant"
"If a V1 is not needed; planned works directly prepare a file for a technical visit,Relevant"
Planned works then plan V2 with the client,Relevant
"After; they send a request to agents to know their availability,Relevant"
"When the agents get the request; they process it taking into account geographical and technical skills and send back their availabilities to planned works,Relevant"
"After receiving the agents' availability; planned works confirm the appointment with the client and send the file to a technician,Relevant"
"They then wait for feedback while the technician gets the request; carries out a technical visit and sends their feedback,Relevant"
"When the feedback is received; planned works handle it and then assess if civil engineering is required,Relevant"
If it is not required the processing is done,Relevant
"Otherwise; the feedback is sent to the contractor and the processing is done,Relevant"
The subscription process is facilitated by the digital transformation: in usual context the customer and the company are engaged into an endless mail exchange demanding the documents for the subscription,Irrelevant
Thanks to Flora a new client only needs to enter some information about his property and his insurance fee is automatically calculated using the dimension and the location of his property,Relevant
"If the new client is not in the defaulters’ database; there is no need for an employee to take part in the process; the contract and insurance details will be automatically digitally created and sent to the customer,Relevant"
"If the client is indeed in the defaulter’s database; Flora needs to conduct a short investigation to determine if they accept the client or not before finishing the process following the classical way,Relevant"
"By using this process; customers are now able to modify their contract online (following a move for instance) by simply entering details about their new property,Irrelevant"
"Their new price is calculated in the same way as in the subscription process; and the rest is also similar: contract and insurance details will be automatically created and sent to the customers as well as the new contract start date,Irrelevant"
Flora allows the customer to make this report via a chatbox within the mobile app in a few steps,Irrelevant
"Of course after the declaration; an external contractor will come to your place to contact the damage but there is no need to extra paperwork that is usually used with the traditional way,Relevant"
The following process is of high interest as switching insurance can be really difficult and require documents and long procedures from both the former and the new insurance company,Irrelevant
"Noting that; this is actually a sub-process of the subscription as most new clients are often covered before subscribing to Flora,Irrelevant"
"To complete the process; customers are invited to enter different information about their former contract such as the company and their contract number,Relevant"
Then the resignation form is generated and signed online by clients using Itsme (Belgian Mobile ID initiative),Relevant
"The rest of the process is handled by Flora; which will deal with the former insurer and will send them the resignation form,Relevant"
"Once these tasks are completed; details about the former contract terms end date and the new contract start date are sent to customers,Relevant"
"At last; the new contract will automatically start at the end of the former one,Relevant"
"By using Flora; a procedure that can take several days for clients is now completed in a few minutes,Irrelevant"
Filling a complaint is one of the most common processes inside an insurance company,Irrelevant
"This is usually a very tedious process for the client but now thanks to the new channel of communication; it is much easier for the clients using the Flora’s application in order to fill a complaint; this can be done in few minutes,Irrelevant"
The prospection and commercial process is triggered by the sales engineers who study the requirements of the prospects/potential clients,Relevant
Then the CEO/COO elaborate sales strategy and set individual goals,Relevant
Sales Engineers receive requests for quotation from clients and afterwards they consider whether the project submitted by the customers is feasible for Alpha or not,Relevant
"If not; the request is declined and the process is stopped,Relevant"
"But if the quotation is feasible; sales engineers work together with the help of R&D engineers to make a technical and commercial offer and ask for client’s agreement,Relevant"
"If the customer’s answer is not favorable; then they try to know on which point they failed to interest the customer; and then the process is stopped,Relevant"
But conversely if the customer’s response is favorable then back office registers new client and its order in the ERP system,Relevant
"The sales engineers compare the order with the quotation made at the customer (price; quantity; product description; delay) and after that; a contract is written by the CEO in collaboration with the sales engineer; with the possibility of having some negotiations with the customers on commercial terms,Relevant"
"If the order is compliant with the offer made; the back office checks the availability of the product and the production delay announced by the ERP system,Relevant"
"Otherwise; the continuity of the process goes back to the steps before (there are once again negotiations with the customers in order to find a common agreement),Relevant"
"When these two tasks are completed; the back office confirms and validates the order to the client; and they register the complete order in the ERP system,Relevant"
"Once this last step is completed; the prospection and commercial process ends,Relevant"
The R&D process starts when a need is expressed,Relevant
"Sales engineers and R&D engineers formalize the request; describe the new product and evaluate the feasibility (cost; strategy coherence ) in the early stages,Relevant"
Then the CEO/COO challenge their analyze and decide if the feasibility is conceivable (the project is stopped if it is not the case),Relevant
Sales engineers and R&D engineers check prototype scale feasibility & conduct tests,Relevant
"If the project is technically validated by R&D; the production engineers go on by checking industrial feasibility and preparing production file,Relevant"
"After that step; the Quality Manager certificates the product and requests client's approval by sending them the previous documents,Relevant"
"If the customer's feedback is good; the bill of materials is made and the current process ends; otherwise the engineers continue to improve the development plans and the process is repeated in the stages of carrying out tests and analyzing feasibility on a prototype scale,Relevant"
The process starts when the engineers make the BOM (Bill of Materials) and send the file with the logistical needs defined by a color code,Relevant
"Consequently; a need is expressed and registered in the ERP system,Relevant"
The supply chain department looks at the BOM and then decides if it needs comparative quotes,Relevant
"- If the purchase amount is estimated to be greater than 10000€; comparative quotes are needed,Relevant"
"In this case; the supply chain department searches suppliers; consults three of them and compare their offers,Relevant"
"Then; it chooses a supplier,Relevant"
"- If the purchase amount is estimated to be less than 10000€; the supply chain department does not need comparative quotes and directly selects a supplier,Relevant"
"After selecting a supplier; there are two options: - If this is a new supplier; the specific team (composed by the COO; the head of the supply chain department and the quality manager) performs a supplier audit,Relevant"
"If the conclusions of this audit are not positive; the supply chain department selects another supplier,Relevant"
"If the audit is conclusive; the supply chain manager registers supplier’s information in the ERP system and sends a notification to the supplier selected,Relevant"
#NAME?
"Afterwards; the supply chain department establishes the order and receives the material once the supplier has fulfilled the order,Relevant"
"In some case; a conformity certificate is required; because AISA works with railway companies (RATP for example) or nuclear sector where high level of traceability is mandatory,Relevant"
#NAME?
#NAME?
"Alpha Innovations controls most of the time the products’ quality; except when it comes to checking small parts (like basic screws; etc),Relevant"
"If the quality control shows material is defective; the supply chain gives the order to the warehouse clerk to return the product to the supplier,Relevant"
"If the quality control is good; the warehouse clerk stores the product and registers it in the ERP system,Relevant"
"Finally; the head of supply chain; the quality manager and the COO evaluate the supplier’s performance; ask for corrective actions if the supplier is not performant enough; and then the process ends,Relevant"
The process starts when the workshop manager receives the project from the R&D department,Relevant
"With the recommendations from the production engineer; he evaluates which and how many workers must be assigned to this project linked to the difficulty’s level of the latter,Relevant"
"With the help of the supply chain manager; he checks when all the needed material (BOM) will be available in stock at the factory,Relevant"
"With all this information; he gives an approximation of the delivery date to the customer,Relevant"
"He receives a set of documents thanks to the ERP system which describes: the BOM (Bill of Materials); mechanical plans; electrical scheme; control prescription; … everything that is needed to organize production of the project,Relevant"
The supply chain department receives the document and launches a production order to the warehouse clerk who prepares and sends all the materials needed to the workshop,Relevant
"At this stage; the workshop manager must prepare assembly aid documents which describe the production process adapted to the type of work to be executed,Relevant"
The function of the workshop manager is also to describe the jobs of each technician involved,Relevant
"Afterwards; technicians operate: first; they prepare nameplates to be able to identify all the products and cables,Relevant"
"Secondly; they assembly the systems while they identify themselves at each step of the process for the tracing and consequently the responsibility,Relevant"
The workshop manager is responsible for describing the complexity of conformity control which is afterwards operate by the technicians,Relevant
"At this stage; test technicians operate the FAI (First Article Inspection); they inspect the finished systems; to see if it is safe; functional and conform to the specifications,Relevant"
"If all tests are conclusive; the system is sent to the shipment employee who will package and send it to customers with the help of other actors (haulers; …),Relevant"
The systems production process ends at the moment the system is submitted to the shipment employee,Relevant
The process is triggered when the product is received by the packaging employee who packages the product,Relevant
"Then; two tasks are done in parallel: addition of a suitable ID label to the package and wedging and wrapping to protect the product,Relevant"
"The packaging employee makes the delivery form and send it to the head of shipment department who is going to give a pick-list-number and; afterwards; registers the pick-list number on the ERP system,Relevant"
"Later on; the packaging employee fills the picklist with the product’s information (weight; date; …) on the ERP system,Relevant"
"Subsequently; the employee stores the product in the shipment area,Relevant"
"After that; the head of shipment management received on the ERP system the picklist completed and then classify the picklist by due date until the delivery day,Relevant"
"When the delivery day has come; the back office does two tasks at the same time: to prepare the delivery note and print it and prepare the invoice and print it as well,Relevant"
"After that; the back office sends the documents to all services concerned via the ERP system (i.e. accounting),Relevant"
"Finally; the packaging employee add the waybill and the delivery note on the package and thereafter he gives the package to the haulers,Relevant"
The process ends when the order is sent,Relevant
The process starts when IT equipment is needed by a service manager,Relevant
The request is first analyzed by the head of the IT Department and they have to decide if the request is justified or not,Relevant
"If the request is not justified; the process ends,Relevant"
"If the request is justified; they also have to decide if they accept it or not (in some cases; the request is justified but the solution requested to this need seems to be inappropriate),Relevant"
"If the request is not accepted (but stays justified obviously); the service manager has the opportunity to adapt the request and suggests a new request; that the head of IT-Department will analyze again and the process starts again,Relevant"
The service manager has also the choice to not adapt his request and the process ends in this case,Relevant
"But if the request is accepted; then the head of IT department asks for a quote,Relevant"
"If it is the first time that the supplier works with the company; the purchasing department has to add this supplier in the suppliers evaluation form,Relevant"
"If the budget or treasury will be affected with this expense; the Chief Financial Officer has to analyze the expense and decides if he validates the expense or not,Relevant"
"If he does not validate it; then the head of the IT Department has to ask for a new quote to a new supplier,Relevant"
"If the expense is validated; the head of the IT Department completes the purchase form and then the purchasing department makes the order and sends it to the supplier,Relevant"
"When the order is ready; the supplier sends it with the purchase documents (that is to say the invoice and the acknowledgement of receipt) to the head of the IT department; who sends after all to the service manager,Relevant"
"Next; both the head of the IT department and the purchasing department compare the purchase order with the delivery and the invoice,Relevant"
"If one of them finds something incorrect; they contact the supplier in order to solve the problem and then compare it again and contact the supplier again until everything is in order,Relevant"
"When everything is correct or if everything was right the first time; the Chief Financial Officer has to validate the purchase,Relevant"
"If he does not validate it; the comparison process between the invoice; the purchase order and the delivery starts again until the amount to be spent aligns with their expectations,Relevant"
"If he validates the purchase; then he pays the invoice and the process ends,Relevant"
The process starts when the need is notified by the receipt of a purchase order form by the service manager,Relevant
"Then; the purchase department has to analyse the demand: if it is not ok; the demand is obviously rejected and the process ends,Relevant"
"Otherwise; they have to request a quote,Relevant"
"If the quote is asked to a new supplier; the purchasing department has to add it into the evaluation suppliers form (data base),Relevant"
"Then; the financial management has to validate the quote: if it is not ok; the demand has to be analysed again but if it is financially ok; the service can be ordered so the service department asks for an intervention,Relevant"
The supplier performs the requested service and sends the purchase documents (purchase order and invoice) afterwards,Relevant
"Next; the purchasing department compares the purchase order with the invoice received and has to validate: if something is wrong; the invoice is not validated and the department contacts the supplier for another validation,Relevant"
"Otherwise; the financial department has to validate it a second time,Relevant"
"Again; if it is not ok; the purchase department has to compare it again but if it is ok; the financial department puts the invoice in payment and the process ends when the service provider is paid,Relevant"
The process starts with the presentation of the candidate at the office,Relevant
He enrolls for the examination,Relevant
The centre manager checks the planning in the license database if the candidate is already planned,Relevant
"If it is not the case; the centre has to create a new file for this candidate in the license database,Relevant"
"Then; he registers the candidate to the examination,Relevant"
The applicant has to pay for his registration,Relevant
"If the payment is not received; the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant"
"Otherwise; the process continues and the centre manager checks the validity of the candidate and guide’s ID cards,Relevant"
"If those are invalid; the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant"
"If; on the contrary; the ID cards are acceptable; the centre manager checks the age conditions,Relevant"
"If those are not fulfilled; the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant"
"Otherwise; the process continues and the centre checks that the ID card corresponds to the candidate,Relevant"
"If he notices a mismatch; the Chief examiner seizes his ID card and warns the authorities,Relevant"
The candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
"If it corresponds; the centre checks the temporary driving license and the certificate from the municipality,Relevant"
"If those are invalid; the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant"
"If those are valid; there are 2 possibilities,Relevant"
Either the applicant has learned by a driving school or by another guide,Relevant
This second case requires an additional step: the centre checks the guide driving license,Relevant
"If his driving license is invalid; the process ends and the candidate is rejected,Relevant"
"If it is valid; the process keeps going,Relevant"
This step is not necessary if the candidate has learnt by a driving school,Relevant
"Next; the centre checks the vehicle documents,Relevant"
"If those are not valid; the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant"
"Otherwise; the process continues with the examiner who checks the vehicle state,Relevant"
"If he evaluates the car as defective; the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant"
"On the contrary; if the vehicle is in good conditions; the centre manager makes a random selection of the examination track thanks to the IT system of the company and the candidate is allowed to take the examination,Relevant"
The candidate is accepted and the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when the candidate arrives at the centre,Relevant
An employee of the centre completes the identity verification form at least every 25 candidates and checks the validity of the client’s ID card (according to the regulation),Relevant
"If the ID card is not valid; the process ends and the client is refused,Relevant"
"If it is valid; the client’s age is checked; once again according to the legislation,Relevant"
"If the candidate doesn’t fulfil the age requirement; the process ends and he is refused,Relevant"
"In the case where the client fulfils the age requirement; the centre employee checks that the card corresponds to the candidate,Relevant"
"If the card is not corresponding to the candidate; the employee takes the ID card; warns the authorities and the process ends,Relevant"
The client is thus refused because of failure and fraud,Relevant
"If the card corresponds to the candidate; the centre employee checks the number of failures and the driving school certificate if necessary,Relevant"
The employee then registers the candidate,Relevant
"If a session is not available; the client asks the availability and/or takes an appointment; then comes back to the beginning (arrival),Relevant"
"If a session is available; he checks that the client is already in the database,Relevant"
"If the client isn’t; the centre employee creates a new file in the Database Permis (‘DB Permis’),Relevant"
"If the client was already registered or has just been registered; the employee registers the candidates and checks his data,Relevant"
"After that the client has paid; the employee generates a session for the candidate; according to his category; from the ‘DB Permis’ which generates a random series of questions,Relevant"
The client takes the exam,Relevant
"If a fraud is detected during the exam; the centre interrupts the exam and warns the authorities; the client is then refused (failure and fraud) and the process ends,Relevant"
"In each case; the results are printed by the centre,Relevant"
"If the exam is passed; the client takes the reading test; and the process ends with the delivery of the provisional driving licence (PCP); the results and some information,Relevant"
"If the exam is failed; the client is given the results of the exam,Relevant"
The process starts when the candidate arrives at the examination centre,Relevant
There is a previous control of the vehicle by the examinator before he makes a random selection for the track with the IT system,Relevant
Then he takes note of the track and manoeuvres,Relevant
The customer makes the track and manoeuvres directed by the examinator (according to the traffic regulations),Relevant
The examinator assesses the abilities of the candidate,Relevant
"If he makes a dangerous manoeuvre; the exam is interrupted,Relevant"
Otherwise the examinator makes a global assessment of the exam and he registers the assessments with the IT system,Relevant
He encodes the results and sends them to the server of the company (with the IT system and the protocol of the exam),Relevant
"Then he archives the protocol and at the same time; he gives the result to the candidate,Relevant"
"If the result is a success; the exam is passed but if it is a failure; the exam is failed,Relevant"
The first step in the registration process is the quote calculation,Irrelevant
It begins when someone needs to obtain a tenant insurance,Relevant
The user will then take an interest in Flora and go to the website,Relevant
"The customer will go on ""découvrir mon prix"" and so the quote calculation process begins,Relevant"
The user is now on the page where he selects the type of housing,Relevant
"It can be a house (2 or 3 faces); a villa (4 faces) or a flat,Irrelevant"
Selecting an accommodation type enables the user to move forward to the next screen,Relevant
The user just has to click on the right button to go further (there is no “continue” button),Relevant
Then the user has to enter his address to go further in the process,Relevant
"When the user starts typing his address; a drop-down list appears with all the street names corresponding to the entered characters,Relevant"
"In order to move forward; the user has to select one address in the Google results and the system moves on directly to the next page,Relevant"
"If the user enters an address abroad; the pop-up window appears informing the user that Flora is only available in Belgium,Relevant"
"If the user lives in a zone subject to flooding; a pop-up window also appears to say that the house is located in a zone subject to flooding and that the user cannot be insured for the moment; the user can be redirected to the Ethias website,Relevant"
"If the address is unknow : the message “""Je ne trouve pas mon adresse""” appears,Relevant"
"The user is redirected to the page where he has to enter manually his address; he has to complete manually all the fields,Relevant"
"If the address is known; located in Belgium and complete; the user clicks on “Confirmer” and is then redirected to the monthly rental amount page,Relevant"
The monthly rental amount is a mandatory field,Irrelevant
"If it is left empty; a warning red notice must ask the user to correctly fill it out (Max of characters: 7),Relevant"
"If the user enters a higher rent; the pop-up window appears informing the user that Flora doesn’t insure properties with a rent higher than 1500€,Relevant"
The user can decide to move on to the Ethias website or exit the Flora’s quote calculation process by clicking on the X in the upper-right hand corner / the button “Je comprends”,Relevant
"The user then goes to the ""Prix"" page; which mentions the price of the rental insurance for his property at his address,Relevant"
The price covers the civil liability and the content of the housing,Irrelevant
The user can choose to add or not add the vandalism cover,Relevant
"To finish this process; the user has to tick the Checkbox of the terms conditions before being able to continue,Relevant"
"Once the quote calculation process is complete; a customer profile must be created,Irrelevant"
"This process starts with the screen ""mon compte"" ; the user must fill in different information: First name; name; date of birth; phone number; email address and password are mandatory fields,Relevant"
"Before going to the next step; the system makes a verification about the age of the user,Relevant"
"In fact; the user must be between eighteen and hundred years old because they consider that outside this age slice; you are less likely to take out insurance,Irrelevant"
"So; if the customer is under eighteen or over hundred; the process stops; and the customer gets stuck,Relevant"
"The next step consists in checking if the email address still exists in the system because it is possible to have a user who has given the account creation just after entering the personal information; or who has left the process for a moment perhaps to pick up where he left off later on,Relevant"
"So; if the email address did not still exist; Flora will then send an email to the user in order to allow him to validate his email address,Relevant"
"In the email; the user can push on a button “Valider mon compte” or on another “Je n’ai pas demandé de compte Flora”,Relevant"
"If the email address still existed; we can go on the next step,Relevant"
"After that; Flora has to check if the email address is still validated,Relevant"
"If it is the case; the account is created and it’s the final event,Relevant"
"If the user did not confirm his email address and pushed on button “Je n’ai pas demandé de compte Flora”; the process stops; and no account will be created for the user,Relevant"
"Just in order to precise a little; at the end of this business process; the user is still not a customer; he is a prospect,Irrelevant"
He will become a customer once he will be logged into the application as such,Irrelevant
This step of the process is important because it will be impossible for the user to use the app as long as he is not a real client,Irrelevant
"Indeed; he will be considered as a prospective customer until the moment he makes the payment,Irrelevant"
"Without this payment; even if the user created an account; he is not allowed to gain access to the application,Irrelevant"
The first stage consists in asking the client information about his moving in the housing,Relevant
"On the one hand; if he already moved in; Flora will invite the client to state if he is insured for this housing or not,Relevant"
"In case of a client who is already insured; Flora will ask the user to enter the contact details of his previous insurer and we will deal with the termination of his contract,Relevant"
"On the other hand; if the user has not moved in yet; the app will request him to enter the date of moving in and his future address,Relevant"
"After that; he will be invited to choose a payment method,Relevant"
"The client will soon be allowed to choose among three different means of payment : with a credit card; via PayPal or via Apple Pay,Relevant"
"For the moment; there are only two payment methods available : the credit card and PayPal,Irrelevant"
"By selecting the credit card as mean of payment; the user will be redirected to the next screen,Relevant"
"At that point; he will have to encode his card number; the name of the card; the validity date and the CVV number,Relevant"
"Obviously; there will be no direct debit before the start of the contract,Irrelevant"
"In the case where the user would want to pay with PayPal; he would be redirected to the PayPal interface in order to check that the available balance on PayPal is sufficient to pay,Relevant"
"Then; the user can click on the button “Suivant” which will redirect him to another screen with a summary of his contract : type of housing; monthly rental amount; full address; contract duration; price; credit card registered and so on,Relevant"
"After having checked the elements of his contract; he must accept the general terms conditions before subscribing to the product and paying,Relevant"
"Then; he can click on “Confirmer” and in that case; it means that the user wants to confirm and pay,Relevant"
"Once the contract is confirmed; the client will be invited to download the application in order to handle his insurance directly from the application,Relevant"
"From the moment he confirmed; the contract is forward to him by email,Relevant"
"Finally; at this step of the process; the client receives a confirmation email with the documents related to the contract attached,Relevant"
"If he receives this email; it means that the payment is accepted and therefore; the contract is confirmed,Relevant"
"From a legal point of view; it is mandatory to send a confirmation email to the policyholder,Irrelevant"
"From that moment; the client can log in into his account; access his profile and his documents; ask questions; manage decisions and request a refund in the event of a damage,Irrelevant"
"First of all; when the client wants to create a new claim; he needs to open the chat bot in the app,Relevant"
The date of the damage will be requested from the customer to verify if he was covered by insurance at the time of the damage,Relevant
"If this is not the case; the client will not be compensated,Relevant"
"Then; the client will receive a reduced list of the frequent damage and will be asked to select the damage concerned,Relevant"
"If the damage is not in this list; then it may be part of the list of damages not covered and; in this case; the customer will not be compensated,Relevant"
Or the client may request to be put in contact with the CCM (customer communication management),Relevant
"However; if the damage has been found on the list; the process continues normally,Relevant"
The client will then be asked whether or not it was a personal property,Relevant
"If it is; then the client will give more information about the asset,Relevant"
"And if it is not; the process continues to the next step,Relevant"
"In that step; the client will have the opportunity to report another claim; if this is the case; the client will be sent back to the beginning of the process in order to give all the necessary information again,Relevant"
"If there is no further damage to report; then the customer will be asked for the owner’s contact information,Relevant"
"Afterwards; the application will ask the customer if there is at least one property that belongs to the owner,Relevant"
In both cases a summary adapted to the situation will be sent to the customer,Relevant
"Finally; if the customer wishes to conclude and send the notification of the damages; he will have to click on ""Envoyer""; the damage will be transferred and the case will be finished,Relevant"
"Once the damage has been notified and that the claim has been transferred to ""Ma demande""; it will be transferred to the customer manager,Relevant"
"He will then process the claim; starting by judging whether or not it is important,Relevant"
"If the claim is significant; he will call in an expert to determine the amount of compensation,Relevant"
"Otherwise; he will define the amount himself on the basis of the information provided by the customer in the Flora application,Relevant"
It is possible that the customer manager may not have the necessary information to calculate the refund,Relevant
"In this case; he will send an e-mail to the customer to request the missing information,Relevant"
"Once the amount of compensation has been determined; the customer manager will enter it into the application,Relevant"
"Then; if this amount is higher than 1000 euro; the Flora application must approve the compensation request before sending it to the customer,Relevant"
"If Flora detects a flaw; it will inform the customer manager who will re-analyse the situation,Relevant"
"Otherwise; if Flora approves the request for compensation or in the event that the amount is less than 100 euro; the compensation proposal will be sent to the customer,Relevant"
The next step depends on the client’s approval of the compensation proposal,Irrelevant
"If the customer approves; Flora will ask for the customer’s bank account number and an electronic signature via ITSME,Relevant"
"Once the compensation proposal has been signed; the client will be reimbursed and will receive a notification that the file has been closed,Relevant"
The client receives the compensation amount on his bank account and the process is thus completed,Relevant
"If; on the other hand; the customer does not approve the compensation proposal; Flora will forward this refusal to the customer manager,Relevant"
"The acquisition of lands and buildings process by Spi follows a certain chain of events; decisions and actions,Irrelevant"
"First of all; they start by asking the government procurement if there is any land or buildings available,Relevant"
"In order to do this; they send a letter expressing their wish,Relevant"
"If there are no lands or buildings available; they express to the government procurement that they are aiming to buy; so they fill in a form to be added to the waiting list and they will be notified when an opportunity comes along,Relevant"
"If something is available; the procedure usually begins with an estimation of the property solicited by the government procurement,Relevant"
"Then; this estimation is reported to Spi,Relevant"
"Since Spi is aiming to rent or sell these acquisitions; before they buy lands and buildings; they need to be sure that they will bring interests to their clients,Relevant"
"So; they decide to carry out a market research and see if the assets are interesting enough,Relevant"
"If it is not interesting; they decide to drop off,Relevant"
"If it is interesting; then Spi asks their experts to carry out their own estimation of the asset,Relevant"
"If the estimation matches; they carry out the next step otherwise the company and the government procurement try to reach an agreement,Relevant"
"Without any agreement found; the company can decide to end the acquisition process,Relevant"
"After they agree on a price; Spi asks the bank if they are allowed to have a loan,Relevant"
"To do so; the financial department provides the bank with the expertise and the result of the market research,Relevant"
"Then; they have to wait 10 days to have a decision from the banker,Relevant"
"If after 10 days they don’t have an answer; they can reschedule an appointment to have the final decision (usually if they don’t have an answer after 10 days; it’s because the loan has been rejected so during this second meeting; they will try to find a new arrangement),Relevant"
"If no arrangement has been found; the process ends here,Relevant"
The commercialization of plots of lands and building starts when Spi receives by email the interest of a client to buy a building or a plot of land,Relevant
"Then; it has to acknowledge/confirm the receipt in order to follow the sale,Relevant"
"Once; the receipt acknowledges; Spi has a free two-month reservation to send a form to the candidate buyer,Relevant"
"This one fills out the request and sends it back to the company which has the duty to complete; sign and date the form,Relevant"
"Once; this first step done; Spi’ executive board has one month to take a decision about the sale of its plots of land or building,Relevant"
The agreement between these two parts remain valid for a period of six months,Relevant
"Then; the company gives an agreement in principle to formalize the contract and the sales otherwise; if the candidate buyer doesn’t respect this six-month validity; Spi cancels the contract and the client is obliged to give 10% of the sum of the land or the building to the company (e.g. when the client doesn’t want to buy the land anymore before the 6 months),Relevant"
"When the six months are respected; Spi will receive the 10% of the value of the land by the candidate buyer and it has to sign the deed,Relevant"
"Later; Spi checks if the payment is correct and if the reservation fee has been paid in one month,Relevant"
"Then; if all is done in the rules; Spi orders the measuring plan and the placement of markers on the sold property,Relevant"
The reception of the proof credit from a bank by Spi leads to the selling of the land,Relevant
"Otherwise; if the reservation fee is not received in one month; the order is rejected,Relevant"
The Head of the rental department receives a request concerning the rental of a building,Relevant
"He sends the request to the legal department; they check whether the request is complete and legal,Relevant"
"If the document is not complete; the client gets a message saying that he has to complete his documents,Relevant"
"If the document is complete; the head of the rental department schedules a meeting with the client,Relevant"
During this meeting the client proposes a price,Relevant
"If the price is too low the head of the department does a counterproposal; which is then accepted or not by the client,Relevant"
"When the client refuses; the negotiations are over and we consider the process done,Relevant"
"When a correct deal has been reached by the 2 parties; we draft a contract,Relevant"
When the contract is signed the process has reached its end,Relevant
"The appeal for intervention process in which the trigger event is the need for services such as reparations; gardening;… Once the problem is identified; the maintenance department looks for companies with qualified people who could fill this need and then get in touch with that company,Relevant"
They explain the need or issue,Relevant
"If this person is indeed qualified for this request; a quote is asked,Relevant"
"When the quote from the company is received; the maintenance department examines it,Relevant"
"If it seems correct; they send it to the financial department which determines if it fits the company's budget in order to submit their agreement or not,Relevant"
"If they do agree; the maintenance department contacts the company again to complete the final terms and sign a contract,Relevant"
"Otherwise; they explain to the company that they do not want to go any further and restart the search for qualified people,Relevant"
"Once both parties have signed the contract; the financial department proceeds with the payment,Relevant"
"Finally; the maintenance department checks the service delivery to be sure that it is well done and that it meets their expectations,Relevant"
"The data analysis process is done in several steps: First; data analysts collect data from different sources for every sector,Relevant"
"Then; they merge the data from different sources and make a relation between them; unnecessary data is cleaned in order to concentrate on the economic analysis,Relevant"
Data analysts analyze the evolution of the annual revenue of the companies for each sector and they combine the data of SPI with the one coming from the outside sources,Relevant
"Finally; the results are interpreted; and the analysts make the best economic analysis possible and come to a conclusion,Relevant"
"The report of the analysis is then published in the database of the company; so that it is accessible to everyone,Relevant"
Everything starts when a student is positive for the COVID-19,Relevant
"The school will receive the information via email; phone or even via SMS,Relevant"
"Whether it’s via phone; the school management will ask some specific questions such as : what was the last day in class; when did the student do the test; when did the student receive the results and so on,Relevant"
"Then they will fulfil the file with their own information such as the place where the student is sitting in class; the schedule from each class; … To do so; they must dispose of the class plans,Relevant"
"Moreover; it should be done regarding one clear and precise model,Irrelevant"
"Once the file is completed; they can start analysing the information,Relevant"
The first and the most important one is to know who the students with high risks are,Relevant
"For that; they will consult the class plans and will make groups of students : those who are behind the positive student are not impacted; nevertheless those who are on both sides from this student are risky only if they have had close contact with the positive student without masks,Relevant"
"Unfortunately; this operation is hard; because of option courses,Irrelevant"
"Indeed; there are a lot of different class plans for these courses meaning that students are not always sitting next to the same students depending on the courses,Irrelevant"
"Once every single information has been collected; they will send the complete file to the Safety Advisor via email,Relevant"
"When she receives the email; she will make a first analysis then she will either transfer the file to the PSE (the School Medicine) or just will share the information that there is one more positive student in the school in order to receive a solution to implement,Relevant"
"However; if it is an urgent situation the school management will take the decision to close a class without consulting the PSE,Relevant"
"In the normal process; the PSE will analyse the sent file and will send instructions to the Safety Advisor who will send them to the school management,Relevant"
"On the one hand; students with high risks will receive a mail with the procedure to apply and a coming-back date,Relevant"
"On the other hand; students with no risks will receive a small mail to be aware of the positive student,Relevant"
"If it is possible; one or two members of the school management will go to the concerned class to give some extra information about the s-positive student and answer some questions,Relevant"
"If the class is closed; the school management will send another email to specify it,Relevant"
Then they will phone each parent,Relevant
"After that; each excluded student will receive work on the LMS platform and thereby a coming-back date,Relevant"
The process begins when a teacher is absent,Relevant
"If the teacher is absent for more than 3 months (at least 15 weeks); then they have to hire a ""priority temporary""; that is a teacher who has already given lessons either in the school or in a group of schools attached to the school for at least 360 days (accumulated; not necessarily in the same school),Relevant"
"In this case; the management looks in its database for a priority temporary,Relevant"
"If there is a priority temporary in the database; they contact him/her by phone,Relevant"
"Finally; a management member sends the schedule of the teacher to be replaced to the substitute teacher and the teacher is replaced,Relevant"
"If the teacher is absent for less than a day; then he is not replaced,Relevant"
"However; if he/she is absent for more than a day; then a substitute teacher must be found,Relevant"
"To find a substitute teacher; there are two possible ways: either the candidate has sent his/her CV (printed and classified in a folder in order of importance of the title); or via the website ""Primoweb""; on which we will be able to go do a search according to the teacher you want to hire,Relevant"
"Management will be able to enter a series of criteria; such as the duration of the exercise; the branch of expertise and so on,Relevant"
"Then; after pushing on the search button; they can see the number of titles required; of sufficient titles and of shortage titles,Relevant"
"In the case of application by CV; the candidate selection sub-process begins when the file containing the applications is opened: If there are required titles available; then these are directly selected,Relevant"
"Otherwise; we go to sufficient titles,Relevant"
"If there is no sufficient title; we move on to shortage titles,Relevant"
"If there is no shortage title; we move on to unlisted shortage titles,Relevant"
"In the case of a candidate who has none of these titles; it would be considered an error in the system; and the process would end,Relevant"
"Then; the CV is downloaded by all members of the management,Relevant"
"In the case of ""Primoweb""; we will first choose the required titles; then the sufficient titles; and then the shortage titles (the unlisted shortage titles are not listed on ""Primoweb""),Relevant"
Then we send an email to the candidate,Relevant
"If he/she accepts; his CV is downloaded by all members of the management,Relevant"
"If he/she refuses; then the management goes back to ""Primoweb""; and looks for another replacement; again in order of degree of importance,Relevant"
"If he/she does not respond within 3 days; the management returns to ""Primoweb""; and searches for another replacement; always in order of degree of importance,Relevant"
This process can sometimes take a very long time,Irrelevant
"After downloading the candidate's CV; the members of the management will judge whether it is interesting or not,Relevant"
"If it's not interesting; that ends the process and the candidate is rejected,Relevant"
"If the CV is interesting; we are faced with 2 situations,Relevant"
"If the situation is urgent; for example when a teacher falls ill; then the substitute teacher is directly contacted by telephone to replace the absent teacher,Relevant"
"If the situation is not urgent; or at least foreseeable; for example in the case of a work stoppage related to pregnancy; then they will send an email to the candidate to prepare an interview,Relevant"
The management team will then do the interview,Relevant
"If the interview is successful; a member of the management phones the candidate to confirm the replacement of the teacher,Relevant"
"If the interview is not good; the candidate is rejected,Relevant"
"After calling the candidate; they usually send the schedule of the teacher to be replaced,Relevant"
The process starts when the teacher wants to do an excursion with his students,Relevant
"Once the teacher has found an excursion; he/she has to download an excursion document located on the digital workspace of the school in order to complete the first point of the document,Relevant"
Then he/she has to send that document to the school management where they will check for the validity of the document,Relevant
If the document is not valid the process comes to an end and the excursion will not take place,Relevant
If the document is valid the school management has to decide if they want to let the teacher carry out the excursion or not,Relevant
If they decide to not give the permission to execute the excursion the process comes to an end,Relevant
"If they decide to let the teacher do the excursion; they have to sign the document and send it to the accountant,Relevant"
The accountant will then evaluate the price of the excursion and he/she will inform the teacher,Relevant
"The teacher will then inform the parents of the excursion and give them all the necessary information such as the location; the price; the date; and some general information about it,Relevant"
"After that; the teacher has to wait for the parents' decision to either let go or not their child on the excursion,Relevant"
Once the teacher has received the parents' decision he/she will book the excursion and carry it out,Relevant
Once the excursion is done the teacher has to complete the rest of the excursion document and to send it to the accountant,Relevant
The accountant will then complete the document with other necessary documents such as the invoice and he/she will also mention the fees of the excursion in the periodic settlement of the students so that the fees will be added to what the parents have to pay at the end of the period,Relevant
After that the document is archived and the process is completed,Relevant
"Because of the covid crisis; Sainte-Véronique had to modify their organisation of parents’ meeting process,Irrelevant"
"Indeed; parents cannot enter the school anymore,Irrelevant"
The school tried the new process out in June last year and they improved it for this year,Irrelevant
The process starts when report cards are encoded in the specific software used by the school,Relevant
The student’s report is then received by his or her parents,Relevant
"In the report card; there is a comment section in which parents can find the teachers the school wants them to meet,Irrelevant"
An online form is created on the LMS and sent to the parents for each year,Relevant
"The questions are the following : first name and last name of the student; class; name of the person filling the form; phone number of this person; a multiple choice question with three time intervals and who are the three teachers the parents want to meet,Irrelevant"
"Once the due date to fill in the form is reached; the form is closed by the IT manager,Relevant"
The form is exported in an Excel format and the table is shared with the teachers on the LMS,Relevant
The table is posted on the right year group,Relevant
Teachers can download the document and check whether the parents who were asked to meet them are on the list,Relevant
If they are not on the list the teacher has to add them,Relevant
"Once it is done; the teacher can schedule the phone calls,Relevant"
"If needed; the school can provide some phones and a room for teachers to call the parents,Relevant"
"If during the parents’ meeting the teachers notices an exceptional situation; he or she has to notify the school management,Relevant"
The school management will then handle the case depending on the situation,Relevant
"Every new year; Collège Sainte-Véronique opens its enrolment process; which consists of registering first-year students for the following academic year,Relevant"
"Before entering the heart of the process; the school has to achieve some optional or mandatory activities in order to prepare the enrolment period,Relevant"
"The mandatory one is to communicate the school capacity for first-year students as well as the number of classes in the different sections (general path; immersion path),Relevant"
"For the optional ones; on the one hand; they have the possibility to enter into partnerships with other institutions to facilitate the movement of students from one school to another,Relevant"
"On the other hand; a first contact may be organized,Relevant"
"Then; from February 10 th ; the first enrollment phase starts and pupils can hand over their application form to the school,Relevant"
"Of course; the school must check if the application form is correct and well-filled,Relevant"
If it is not the case the application is refused and cancelled,Relevant
"Next; we need to distinguish the first and the second enrolment phase because applications will not be handled in the same way,Relevant"
Registration requests must therefore be allocated to the period corresponding to them,Relevant
"The first phase begins on February 10 and ends on March 7; while the second phase is opened from April 27 to August 24,Relevant"
"First registration phase Each application for registration must first be registered and then updated in the register; which in most cases takes the form of a database,Relevant"
In each application form there are two sections that have to be completed by parents,Irrelevant
"The general part has to be hand-written; but for the confidential part; parents have the choice to fill it online or in paper format,Relevant"
"If the parents choose the paper format; the school is responsible for mailing the confidential section to CIRI,Relevant"
"Otherwise; with the online form; the form is directly transmitted to CIRI,Relevant"
"Finally; the school sends a confirmation mail to say that the application has been handled correctly,Relevant"
"Once March 7 is reached; the school closes the first registration phase,Relevant"
"If there are more registrations than available places; pupils will be ranked according to different criteria by CIRI,Relevant"
The ranking is used to attribute places to top-ranked pupils,Relevant
The ranking and the result of the selection has to be sent to the pupil and parents,Relevant
If the pupil has been selected a registration certificate is created,Relevant
"Else; the pupil is put on the waiting list,Relevant"
"If there were not more registrations than available places; a registration certificate is immediately created,Relevant"
"Second registration phase As for the first phase; the school has to register each application and update the register book,Relevant"
"However; it is not necessary to send the confidential section to CIRI because this part is used to make the ranking,Relevant"
"After that; either the school is already complete and the pupil has to be put on the waiting list; or there are still places left and a registration certificate can be immediately created for the pupil,Relevant"
A student in phase 2 will not be given priority over a student in phase 1 in the waiting list,Relevant
From now the two phases can be gathered in one common path,Relevant
"On the side of students who received a certificate of registration; the school has to request that the pupil provides his CEB,Relevant"
"If the CEB is received before September 1; the process carries on,Relevant"
"Else; the application will be rejected and a certified refusal letter with return receipt requested will be sent,Relevant"
"Then; at the start of the school year; attendance will be taken and if the pupil is not present; he will have to justify his non-attendance within 8 days; otherwise he will be expelled,Relevant"
"On the side of students who are on the waiting list; they have to wait until a place becomes available,Relevant"
"If it is the case; the school will inform the pupil of the situation and will ask him whether he wants to take the place or not,Relevant"
"If so; then a registration certificate will be written; and the process will follow the normal path described earlier,Relevant"
"If the student refuses the place; then his application will be cancelled,Relevant"
A student on the waiting list can also cancel his or her application by sending a message to the school,Relevant
"And lastly the waiting list is closed on August 24; which means that all students still on it will receive a certificate of refusal,Relevant"
"The recruitment is dealt with by the administrator; Pierre Girretz; himself,Irrelevant"
"Indeed; as mentioned before; the company does not have an HR department nor a “true” recruitment system established since the administrator can easily do this type of work himself,Irrelevant"
"This process is triggered only when a new post is available; and it is done in a more or less informal but also classical way: he receives applications and reads the CVs; then Mr,Relevant"
"Girretz first checks if the applicant has the competencies required for the job (degree; experience; …),Relevant"
"If the resume does not correspond to what is expected; then the application is rejected by email with a thank you for sending the CV,Relevant"
"If the candidate seems to have the right competencies on paper; then he receives a notification to fix a date for an interview,Relevant"
"Right after the interview; the administrator evaluates the candidate on his personality,Relevant"
"Indeed; Mr. Girretz puts a lot of importance on his “gut feeling”,Irrelevant"
"So if the personality matches; then the candidate is given a trial period to see the quality of his work; see if he can work with the team; and to check if the person understands what the company needs and if he will be involved in the future,Relevant"
"If the candidate does not fulfill these characteristics; then his application is rejected after the trial period,Relevant"
"Otherwise; if the administrator is happy with his work; he scans the person’s ID and bank cards and they both sign the hiring document given by Securex and finally; the applicant is officially hired after declaring the recruitment to the Dimona,Relevant"
This process consists of the reception of the different supplies needed to build the pellet stoves,Irrelevant
"First; the supplier receives a notification with the item Sûti needs; then they prepare the order and notifies the company when it is ready to be sent,Relevant"
"When the items are received; the head of the production checks their quality by following the production quality sheet’s instructions and ticks the boxes corresponding,Relevant"
"If their quality is ok; then the item’s QR codes are scanned to be registered on the system and then each item is placed at the post where it will be needed to build the stoves,Relevant"
"In other words; the head of the production paves the way for the “order preparation process”,Irrelevant"
"However; if the items are defective; then a letter is written to explain the problem to the supplier; and the supplies are sent back to receive better ones,Relevant"
"When a client wants to buy a stove; he needs to request a quote on Sûti’s website and to choose from a list of characteristics his dream pellet stove,Relevant"
"Then; when the company receives it; assuming every item is in stock; the order preparation process can begin,Relevant"
"Employees working in the production line start by identifying the type of stove the client wishes to order (they write down the model; the power of the stove; optional features; …) and they also transfer the quote to the reseller; since he will be the one in charge of providing the final product to the customer,Relevant"
"After that; the production line checks if the items needed for assembly are in stock,Relevant"
"If not; an order request is sent to the supplier to receive the missing supplies,Relevant"
"When every item is in stock; employees search for pieces’ emplacement in the system thanks to the QR code they scanned when they first received the items,Relevant"
"Then; the actual assembly can start: the goods go from post to post; the stove is built little by little at every step,Relevant"
"Once it reaches post number N; the number of posts depending on each case; the final product is fully built and is ready to go through a quality check,Relevant"
"Once this quality check process is done; the pellet stove is packaged in a plastic cover and a wood box,Relevant"
"Finally; it can be shipped to the reseller store; which will be in charge of selling the stove to the customer,Relevant"
"This process is basically about testing the stove from A to Z; looking for leaks; checking for malfunctions; and so on,Irrelevant"
The quality check is once again done in the production line,Irrelevant
The process starts when a stove is done being assembled and ends when it is operational and can be sent to the reseller,Relevant
"In the first step; the employees fill in the production quality sheet by first writing down the stove’s info like the guaranteed number; the model; its options; the customer’s details; and so on,Relevant"
"Next; the stove’s components are checked and tested by following the sheet’s instructions,Relevant"
They then turn the engine on to check it works perfectly and that there is no leak or any other problem as said previously,Relevant
"If there is an issue; then workers use the QR code system we talked about earlier to find which pieces are missing or misplaced in the stove and fix them,Relevant"
"When they are sure the stove is working well; they can start to suck potential dirt and clean the whole stove,Relevant"
"Once both are done; they stick an A++ label and a CE (European Conformity) label on the door of the engine,Relevant"
"After that; the rest of the quality sheet has to be filled up,Relevant"
"Then an instruction sheet; a plan of the stove; and a list of the items are added to the packaging of the pellet stove,Relevant"
"In the end; the product is fully operational and is ready to leave the company,Relevant"
The after-sales process begins when a client needs professional intervention,Relevant
"When the client wishes to do its stove’s annual maintenance; a qualified operator is sent to its home,Relevant"
"In that case; it is not Sûti who is responsible for that operation; but the stoves reseller store; depending on the localization (stores in Belgium; France; Switzerland;…),Relevant"
"So Sûti’s employees will not take care of the maintenance; but rather an external professional who has conducted one of Sûti’s training or a mechanic who has Sûti’s approval to operate on its stoves will do it,Relevant"
"If the client needs an intervention because its stove has a technical problem; then it contacts Sûti,Relevant"
"The administrator; the chief technician; and the head of the production can all take care of the process indifferently,Irrelevant"
"When the company is notified; it then fills in the after-sales form by; between others; selecting the stove type and its features; the MAC & IP addresses of the stove; the type of service it needs; and by writing the customer’s and the reseller’s contact information,Relevant"
"If the stove needs a physical intervention because it cannot be dealt with remotely; then the problem is handed over to MILLE Services; a subsidiary company,Relevant"
"After receiving information on the problem; this company will then send one of its technicians to repair the stove; then the after-sales form will be signed by both the customer and MILLE Services,Relevant"
"Otherwise; if physical intervention is not necessary; which is mostly the case; then Sûti will solve the problem remotely through the internet thanks to the app it recently developed,Relevant"
"So first; they will use this app to detect the problem on the stove; then they will change the engine’s parameters through the remote control system and will fill in the sheet with every problem encountered while doing so,Relevant"
"When they are done; they check if the stove is operational,Relevant"
"If so; the after-sales document is signed and the process is over,Relevant"
"If not; then the stove will need a supplementary intervention physically; thus Sûti contacts MILLE Services and the service is handed to them as stated previously,Relevant"
This process begins with the registration of the quotation,Relevant
"When the welder load is planned; he will assign a design engineer to the project,Relevant"
"First of all; the planner will plan the welder load,Relevant"
"After that; several things will be made simultaneously,Relevant"
#NAME?
#NAME?
"After that; the welding engineer will give the soudage instructions,Relevant"
Then the process will continue with the calculation engineer who will make the calculation,Relevant
"When these two simultaneous parts of the process will be covered; the pawn can move on to the resolution of questions task; executed by the design engineer,Relevant"
"When all the questions will be covered; it is the task of the project manager to validate the project,Relevant"
"Now; it will be up to the client to look at the drawing to approbate it in order to launch the creation of the project,Relevant"
"If the customer has other questions; he will send an email to the company to disapprove the drawing,Relevant"
The design engineer will be obliged to do the task of questions resolution again,Relevant
"If the customer approves the drawing; the company will receive an email from him,Relevant"
"After having received the customer approbation; the company will purchase its raw materials,Relevant"
The project will then be sent to the workshop,Relevant
Two sub processes will then be required simultaneously,Relevant
The production traceability and the inspection,Relevant
"After that; the calculation note will be drafted by the calculation engineer and the welding book by the welding engineer,Relevant"
The plan “as built” will then be drawn,Relevant
The process ends with the expedition,Relevant
"It is important to know that Into this process; each thing that will be associated with creation or assignment will be included in the ERP in the file created in the quotation registration,Irrelevant"
The process begins when the purchasing department receives a purchase need,Relevant
They will first analyze the request,Relevant
"Then; they will check if an authorized provider exists,Relevant"
"In fact; they must have to work with suppliers accepted by Ortmans in order to be certain of the quality of the service,Irrelevant"
"If a valid supplier exists for the requirement then we send him a request for quotation If this is not the case; the quality assurance manager will seek out a new supplier and evaluate it,Relevant"
"Once this is done; we can send the request for a quote,Relevant"
"When the purchasing department receives the quote; it is analyzed and then an order is sent to the supplier,Relevant"
"Once the order is received by the storekeeper; he will check the quantity received via the shipping document,Relevant"
"If a control card exists; then a quality controller must inspect the delivery qualitatively,Relevant"
Then the conformity is checked via the ERP by the storekeeper,Relevant
If the order is compliant then it synchronizes the receipt of the order in the ERP and the purchase is complete,Relevant
"If the order is non-compliant; then the quality assurance manager will initiate a process to manage non-compliance,Relevant"
"Once this is completed; the storekeeper can synchronize the receipt of the order in the ERP and the purchase will be completed,Relevant"
"At another time; the billing department will receive the invoice of the order; which will start their process,Relevant"
This will be checked in the ERP,Relevant
"Once the service is notified that the receipt of the order has been synchronized in the ERP; it can proceed to the payment and the payment will be completed,Relevant"
"The improvement action process starts with an improvement demand based on different sources: internal or external audit report; management review; customer complaint; non-compliance; suggestion;etc,Relevant"
The request is then registered in the Excel table by the Quality Assurance Manager (Q.A.M.),Relevant
This excel file will be used all along the process,Irrelevant
"It is important to detect the issue; which means that an analysis of the problem in order to know the ins and outs of each approach will be conducted by the Q.A.M,Relevant"
Then the Q.A.M. will conduct a criticality analysis in order to put the necessary resources on the actions that require it,Relevant
A corresponding amelioration file will be created in the excel table,Relevant
It will help in the choice of whether or not to initiate an improvement action,Irrelevant
"When the amelioration file is finished; the Q.A.M will be able to analyse the issue properly,Relevant"
"If there is no improvement needed; the Q.A.M will answer to the improvement demand applicant with; if possible; an explanation for the refusal,Relevant"
"However; if an improvement is needed; the Q.A.M will determine the action with a reasonable timeframe and a person responsible for the action,Relevant"
Those elements will also be added to the excel file,Relevant
"When the action and those who are in charge of it are defined; the Q.A.M will inform the direction,Relevant"
"When the direction is informed of the issue; she provides the necessary means; and then launches the action,Relevant"
The Implementation of the improvement action is then carried out by the action responsible,Relevant
"In parallel; the Q.A.M follows up this implementation of the improvement action,Relevant"
"When the improvement action is finished; the Q.A.M. checks the effectiveness of the action implemented; i.e. checking that the action focuses on the causes and not only on the consequences,Relevant"
"If the result is satisfying; the improvement action process ends there,Relevant"
"Otherwise; the criticality analysis must be reseen and the process starts again from this point,Relevant"
The process starts when an unconformity is detected,Relevant
A non-conformity must be declared when one or more of the following conditions are met:,Irrelevant
#NAME?
#NAME?
#NAME?
"- “Supplier"" defect (which includes not only raw material suppliers but also service providers and subcontractors),Irrelevant"
"- Customer complaint is the subject of a complaint and therefore a ""complaint"" sheet is completed and if necessary; a ""non-conformity"" sheet is completed,Irrelevant"
The initials of the initiator with the date are added on the sticker who must be created to mark the non-conformity,Relevant
"Next; they have to fill in the non-conformity sheets so that they do not have to search for information that is known to the initiator,Relevant"
The NCS is transmitted to the QAM who is responsible for its follow-up,Relevant
Record in Excel file for follow-up,Relevant
The QAM communicates the NCS to the PM (Project manager),Relevant
The person who is responsible for the non-compliance is the quality manager,Irrelevant
This is the quality manager who makes a proposal for action at the project manager,Relevant
It is the PM who makes the decision whether or not to accept this proposal for action,Relevant
"If the answer is no; the quality manager must make another proposal for action,Relevant"
"If it is approved; the project manager notifies the client and waits to receive the formal acceptance of the client,Relevant"
"If the client doesn't accept; it is up to the quality manager to remake another proposal action,Relevant"
Both QAM and the quality manager must decide for verifications to do if the client accepts the proposal action,Relevant
Now it is up to the quality manager to make improvement actions and verify these actions back,Relevant
"He will close the NCS; remove the marking “non-conformity” and notify the QAM who shall verify the process; make analysis,Relevant"
"After the analysis; if he decides that other improvement actions must be taken; they will make a new one,Relevant"
"If not; they will archive the non-conformity,Relevant"
The process starts when a client needs new equipment and asks the company for a quotation,Relevant
The project manager receives the request and analyzes it in terms of solvency of the client and in terms of capacity of the company to produce the client's equipment,Relevant
An acknowledgment of receipt is sent to the client,Relevant
"The project manager asks the management for an approval and; depending what the management will decide; the client’s request will be approved or not,Relevant"
"If the request is rejected; the project manager will send a rejection to the client; otherwise; the process continues; and the project’s file is created with an ERP’s number,Relevant"
"Then; the design office makes an analysis of the different technical aspects and a quotation request is sent to the supplier,Relevant"
"Finally; with all the information received; the project manager makes the quote; and then; asks the management for some advice about the quote,Relevant"
"Afterward; the project manager establishes the offer (which is registered in the ERP); and sends it to the client,Relevant"
"If the client accepts the offer; the project manager receives the order form,Relevant"
The order form is registered in the ERP system and a confirmation is sent to the client,Relevant
"The contract is reviewed by the project manager; the file is prepared; and information is sent for the registration to delivery process and the quotation-registration process is ended,Relevant"
This process happens repeatedly throughout the day to journalists,Relevant
"Indeed; they have to write several articles for the next day’s daily journal,Irrelevant"
The main subject of an article usually comes from an informant with a scoop / last minute information or from requests for coverage or news they received (for example through the “alert us” button of their website),Irrelevant
Daily news and important events have priority over more common subjects,Irrelevant
"Therefore; if crucial information is given by someone with a high position or an informant to a journalist; he must not hesitate to dive in and collect more information about it,Irrelevant"
"Once the subject is received or chosen; the first step is confirming the information with a reliable person,Relevant"
We will consider Liège’s Christmas market cancellation as an example,Irrelevant
The journalist obtaining this information then has to ask Liège’s mayor to confirm it,Relevant
"However; if the information comes from the “alert us” button; the journalist will set up a meeting with the person in order to further analyze it,Relevant"
"A subject with incoherent or false information will be rejected; whereas the process will continue for a reliable and true subject,Relevant"
"If a journalist were to obtain crucial information; it must be published (even partially) as soon as possible so that it is not stolen from the competition,Relevant"
"Thus; it is directly posted on Sudpresse’s paying website,Relevant"
"On the contrary; if the information can wait; the journalist should collect more details about it,Relevant"
"Once it is done; the journalist makes a synthesis of the information he has received to this point; to know what he should search next,Relevant"
"In both cases; phone calls; emails and internet researches will follow in order to complete and detail the current subject,Relevant"
The information research process ends as soon as the journalist has gathered enough detailed information to write the article,Relevant
The journalist is responsible for this process from its start to its end,Irrelevant
"Sometimes; as demonstrated in the previous process; information must be revealed without delay to readers with a subscription,Irrelevant"
"That is why the information; written as quickly as possible; will be briefly explained on Sudpresse’s paying website,Irrelevant"
"Following this event; a strategic marketing employee in the “newsroom” creates a teasing placed on the free website,Relevant"
This teasing includes a link to the company's paying website,Irrelevant
"Afterwards; the journalist will progressively continue filling out the online article on the paying website; adding information and upgrading the layout; until it is complete and perfect,Relevant"
The journalist contacts his sources to find new he can add to his article,Relevant
"If he gets new information from a tier; he contacts this tier (that becomes thus one of a source) or any other source who can verify/clarify this new information,Relevant"
The last version of the online article will be published the next morning in the traditional newspaper,Relevant
"Compared to a few years ago; journalists do not write complete articles that only come out the following day as they first have to post them online,Irrelevant"
This applies to any level of importance of the information,Irrelevant
"Then; once the article has been completed and is published on the different websites; and when; due to the tight timing; the article must be finished to be in the next-day’s newspaper; the journalist asks for a page of the next day’s daily journal and starts copying the article’s content,Relevant"
"Before every publication; digital or paper; the articles are corrected by a spelling software a first time and a second time by a professional reviewer whose job is to avoid mistakes in the spelling and to ensure an optimal layout for the article,Relevant"
"Once the page for the daily newspaper is finished; it is sent to the rotary press in Nivelles,Relevant"
This concludes the article writing and publishing process,Relevant
"As soon as the pages from the different upcoming newspapers are received; the printing process begins at the Nivelles printing,Relevant"
"First; relief plates are made for every single page of each newspaper,Relevant"
"Then; these plates are put four by four on the rotary press,Relevant"
"Once this step is operated; the rotary press is switched on,Relevant"
"Then; plates go in the four primary colors and the newspapers’ pages are printed,Relevant"
"At this stage; a mechanical system allows to assemble pages with one another; fold and bind them to form the newspaper,Relevant"
The newspapers are then automatically packaged and are ready to be shipped,Relevant
"During the whole work of the machine (printing; assembling;…); the work of the employee is simply reduced to monitor the machine,Irrelevant"
The supply process of daily newspapers is critical and is obviously relying on the nature of past processes,Irrelevant
Any delay can be toxic for the supply process and could cause terrible financial losses for Sudpresse and for booksellers themselves,Irrelevant
"First; we will focus on individual newspaper delivery,Irrelevant"
"Newspapers must be ready for delivery at 01:00 a.m. ; they are put into trucks and taken to the sorting office in Brussels,Relevant"
They are then charged 30 minutes before the departure into night trains taking them to the cities where the different sorting centers are located,Relevant
"Once the newspapers are in those centers; vans are used to deliver them to the local post offices,Relevant"
The postmen then deliver the newspapers in individual mailboxes,Relevant
"This must take place before 7:30am; as it is essential that a good part of workers have enough time to read their newspaper before going to work,Relevant"
We will now focus on bookshops delivery,Irrelevant
"Instead of going to the Sorting post office in Brussels; trucks go straight to regional private delivery centers,Relevant"
Newspapers are then sorted and dispatched in vans that deliver over four thousand bookshops all over Belgium,Relevant
This type of delivery should take place even earlier than the individual deliveries (7am at the latest) as bookshops make half of their daily sales before 9 am,Irrelevant
"Through this process description; we realize that timing is essential in the press sector,Irrelevant"
"Nowadays; writing and creating new articles does not suffice to create enough value for multimedia companies,Irrelevant"
"Therefore; various advertising processes are in constant change in the press industry and are therefore impossible to describe entirely,Irrelevant"
"Nevertheless; thanks to the two interviews we have conducted with our contacts at Sudpresse; we were able to identify some crucial steps in these processes,Irrelevant"
"We established earlier that there is a market department running many analyses in order to determine what are the best advertising spots on the website: which format; which size; which colors; which position on the page; etc,Relevant"
"The IT department will then determine who sees what advert and most importantly; these people’s background and profile by using big data,Relevant"
"Once the advertising spots have been defined; it is time for the sales department to intervene,Relevant"
"Using the data previously collected; sales teams have to sell these spots to advertisers,Relevant"
Advertisers have many options,Irrelevant
"On the newspaper; they can choose to advertise on a quarter of a page; half a page or an entire page; knowing that each of these options has a different cost and impact on the reader,Relevant"
Different spots can be chosen on the website,Irrelevant
"One option of advertising on the website is through storytelling; which has been a growing tendency in the previous years,Relevant"
"In this case; advertising is made through an interview of a representative of the concerned company; ending with a link to the company’s website,Relevant"
The interview is in this case realized after the writing of the contract,Relevant
"An advertisement may appear one or multiple times; depending on the agreement that has been made between the sales teams and the advertiser,Relevant"
"Once the advertiser has decided what he wishes to do; a contract is written by the sales department of Sudpresse,Relevant"
"When it is done; the contract is sent to the advertiser,Relevant"
The contract is often approved by the advertisers,Relevant
"If it is not; the contract is reviewed,Relevant"
"A contract is never abandoned because if a contract has been written; it is because there is a demand from an advertiser,Irrelevant"
The advert is then created and published in the chosen canals with a determined frequency and time frame,Relevant
The catering process starts when a customer calls a Poivre&Sel point of sale for its services,Relevant
One of the employees answers the phone call and asks automatically for the date and the number and variety of products wanted,Relevant
The employee then asks for the customer’s usual point of sale,Relevant
"If the client doesn’t call his/her usual point of sale; the employee has to conduct the customer to the usual one and the order is sent there,Relevant"
"If the client is a new or a usual one; 10 the employee then asks for the address,Relevant"
"Afterwards; he checks the availability of the employees on this date and this address,Relevant"
"If none of the employees is available; the process ends,Relevant"
"Otherwise; the employee answering the call determines the type/category of the client and as a result of this proposes a series of products specific to the client,Relevant"
It is then the job of the franchisor (CEO) to emit the invoice to the client,Relevant
He receives the payment and checks if there is any missing information,Relevant
"If information is missing; he sends a formal notice to the customer with the ERP system of Poivre&Sel (Teamleader),Relevant"
The franchisor receives the missing information and if it is still missing the purchase order is rejected,Relevant
"When the payment is completed; the employees can start the order,Relevant"
They deliver the order at the social event and the purchase order is completed,Relevant
The franchising process is quite simple,Irrelevant
Anyone interested in becoming a franchisee can obtain information at a point of sale or/and on the website,Relevant
He then contacts Mr. Buche to ask him if he can become a franchisee,Relevant
Then Mr. Buche will meet with the interested party to explain the principle of his company and its history,Relevant
"After this discussion; he asks the franchisee if he is still interested,Relevant"
The franchisee will then give an answer to the franchisor,Relevant
"If he decides to continue; then Mr. Buche will take him on a day-long immersion trip to his point of sale in order to learn more about the franchisee and to show him how a day in a point of sale goes,Relevant"
"After that day; both parties take a week to think about whether or not they want to continue,Relevant"
The decision comes from both parties,Relevant
"If they continue; the prospective franchisee must sign a confidentiality document,Relevant"
"Once this is done; the franchisee starts looking for a location for their new outlet,Relevant"
"Once he has found it; he will show it to Mr. Buche so that he can take care of the market research and a cost/benefit calculation to see if the location is ideal and profitable,Relevant"
"If it is not; the franchisee has to look for another location,Relevant"
"If it is; the calculations are sent to the franchisee's accountant for validation,Relevant"
"Once validated; it takes a few months for the fieldworks to be completed and then the franchisee pays Mr. Buche for the fieldworks,Relevant"
The franchisee can then finally open his point of sale,Relevant
The franchisee receives the calendar of meetings for the year,Irrelevant
One of the franchisees has a new recipe idea,Relevant
He waits for the next meeting to propose it,Relevant
"Then; we see if the idea is appreciated; if not; we stop,Relevant"
"If it is appreciated; the franchisee; who had the idea; suggests to make a vote,Relevant"
The vote is made with all the franchisees and the franchisor by raising their hand,Relevant
"If the majority raises their hands; we make the recipe; if not the requested is rejected,Relevant"
A customer arrives in front of the cashier at Poivre&Sel to eat,Relevant
"First of all; the cashier asks him whether he is eating on the spot or to take away,Relevant"
"If the customer eats on the spot; the waiter makes him sit down and asks the customer what he wants to eat,Relevant"
"Once the order is taken; the waiter gives the order to the cook who prepares it and gives it back to the waiter once it is ready,Relevant"
The waiter then takes the dish back and serves it to the customer,Relevant
"Then the waiter waits until the customer's meal is over; i.e. when the customer calls the waiter,Relevant"
The waiter will then send him the invoice and receive payment from the customer and then hand over the money received at the cash desk,Relevant
"If the customer has taken out; the cashier asks the customer for the order,Relevant"
Then gives the order to the cook who prepares it and returns it to the cashier once the preparation is finished,Relevant
Then the cashier issues the invoice to the customer who pays it and the cashier gives him his meal,Relevant
"If a product is missing from Poivre&Sel he rings their supplier to see if the product is available; the office (manager) checks the database to see if the product is still in stock,Relevant"
"If the product is available; we ask for the quantity of this product ""x"" at Poivre&Sel which will determine the quantity and then notify the supplier who will be able to prepare an invoice and send it; once the invoice is received and paid the stock manager will supply the product at Poivre&Sel,Relevant"
"If the product is no longer available; the supplier asks for salt and pepper; if he wants to order; if the answer is no it is the end of the process if it is yes the supplier sends all the information (invoice delivery date) by e-mail,Relevant"
The process starts with the arrival of the worker at Emerson,Relevant
A renewal contract is when the end of his last contract is greater than 12 months,Irrelevant
"He goes to the line manager who welcomes him; then he signs the contract and receives the badge,Relevant"
"Later; the line manager accompanies him to the social store,Relevant"
"He begins his training and medical supervision; and the process is over for him,Relevant"
"If the duration of his contract is less than 12 months; it is considered as a first contract,Relevant"
"Therefore; the worker is registered at the guard post; then he is greeted by the head of the department; who signs the contract and accompanies him to the social store and shows the worker the factory,Relevant"
"Later; the HR Business Partner transmits the Welcome Pack to the worker; then the training coordinator receives singled documents and classifies documents in personal files,Relevant"
"If an IT account must be created; the training coordinators must first present and then send the signature of the IT policy,Relevant"
"If not; the worker can receive induction training and medical supervision directly,Relevant"
The process starts with the expiration of the contract,Relevant
"Then; an exit interview takes place with the temporary worker and the coordinator; his release date is encoded on HR Access; the human resources management software package,Relevant"
The C4 (the unemployment certificate) and the certificate of employment is sent and issued to the worker by the coordinator then who then archives the paper file,Relevant
"After that; the worker returns first clothes and keys at the social store and then the badge after the last score,Relevant"
"Finally the HR Payroll Specialist triggers the bonus at the end of year in HR access; applies the legislation on payment of the days after discharge; clears RHT and RTT hours and the process is ended,Relevant"
The process starts with the payment of a deposit,Relevant
Then the HP Payroll Specialist emails to horses’ managers before 10 a.m. to conclude it,Relevant
"Later; he carries out a different point of the checklist and encodes down payment work on the HR Access software,Relevant"
He then downloads the payment batch on the bank's website and requests the lot signature to the Finance Manager who signs it,Relevant
"Finally; the HP Payroll Specialist checks the sent lot and the worker receives the salary,Relevant"
The process begins with the requirement of the Emerson Company,Relevant
The plant HR director invites the hierarchical manager to establish the schedule of objective meetings who will then carry out the evaluation with his employee via the HR Access pre-software and will then transmit to the plant HR director,Relevant
"if the manager has received the evaluations; he must review them; otherwise the plant HR director will invite the hierarchical manager again to review the evaluations and continue the process,Relevant"
"If the assessment is understandable; the plant HR director if we need training; if so; we set up training; and we evolve the performance of the end of the year and the performance assessment is completed,Relevant"
"If the evaluation sent is incomprehensible; the plant HR director discusses with the hierarchical manager who will complete and inform the collaborator who will send the document back to the plant HR director for review evaluation and the process continues normally,Relevant"
The process starts when a position becomes available,Relevant
"The HR Business Partner drafts the internal announcement and the HR Director validates the content of the announcement via the HR Access pre-software; then sends it to the HR Business Partner for the dissemination of the internal announcement,Relevant"
The HR Business Partner determines the evaluation criteria and then receives the applications by email,Relevant
The HR Business Partner conducts interviews and tests and evaluates them afterwards,Relevant
"If the candidates respond to the applications of the function; they are informed by email and their personal data is deleted with the HR access pre-software and finally they are ready to be hired,Relevant"
"If the candidates do not respond to the applications of the function; they consult the reserve of spontaneous applications,Relevant"
The first business process is inbound logistics,Irrelevant
An employee takes care of placing the order with the suppliers,Relevant
All the raw materials needed to manufacture the finished products are stored in a large refrigerated hall within the company,Relevant
There is also a storage room that serves as a freezer because some materials arrive frozen,Irrelevant
The process of outbound logistics is quite similar to that of inbound logistics,Irrelevant
"First of all; the company receives requests for the delivery of goods from outside (supermarkets; small shops; …),Relevant"
"Then; Goumanisto checks its stocks to see if it has the quantities requested by the buyers,Relevant"
"If it does not have them; it will send a note to inform the purchasing company of the impossibility of supplying the quantities requested,Relevant"
"The purchasing company can also decide to maintain the order; in which case Goumanisto will produce the missing products,Relevant"
"Once the products are available; the company will make up pallets that will be sent to the various stores via a delivery company,Relevant"
"As far as the recruitment process is concerned; it starts when a person shows interest in working for the company,Relevant"
"For operators; Goumanisto either uses a temporary employment agency to provide the necessary manpower or receives unsolicited applications; most of which are based on the knowledge of existing workers,Relevant"
Each recruitment procedure consists of a minimum of 2 (sometimes 3) interviews with the applicant,Relevant
"The first one is with the direct manager; i.e. the operations manager if the company is looking to hire an operator,Relevant"
The second interview takes place in the presence of the company's managers,Relevant
"Following this second interview; they decide whether or not the person is suitable,Relevant"
Production is a very important business process at Goumanisto,Irrelevant
"About 50 people are employed in production; and almost half of them come from the sheltered workshop,Irrelevant"
The first room is made up of a recently acquired machine: it allows the various products to be cut very quickly and precisely,Relevant
Four to five workers are needed for this machine to work properly,Relevant
Then there is another machine that weighs the cut products and divides them into different batches according to the quantities required,Relevant
The next step is the reception of the products and their packaging,Relevant
This step is done by production line,Relevant
Currently there is a manual line with 10 people and an automated line with 5 people,Relevant
"The automatic line checks that the machines properly close the boxes with plastic paper; then the manual line closes the boxes with plastic lids,Relevant"
Goumanisto's objective is to acquire a new automated line by February 2021,Irrelevant
"Finally; the various plastic boxes have to be closed and packed in cardboard boxes; both operations are still done manually,Relevant"
This one could be a good candidate for automation,Irrelevant
"Indeed; the labelling and the placing of the products packed in the cardboard boxes are still done manually so it would represent a saving of time if the company were to automate this process,Irrelevant"
R&D is also an important process for the organization,Irrelevant
Members are looking for new product ideas that may appeal to consumers,Irrelevant
Most often the company uses market research done by the wholesale distribution to whom it sells its products instead of doing its own surveys,Relevant
"Then; they analyze the results of market research in order to embark on the development of new ideas of products,Relevant"
The point of product ideas is obviously that these products can be sold in large quantities and at a lower price,Irrelevant
Then they compute the potential costs of producing these new product ideas,Relevant
"If these can be profitable and lead to profit subsequently; they are validated by the R&D department and presented to the general council,Relevant"
"On the other hand; if they could not be profitable; everything falls apart and the process stops,Relevant"
It will therefore be necessary to start all over from the development of new product ideas,Relevant
The process starts when a client wants to employ temporary workers,Relevant
The client sends an email with a job description to the agency,Relevant
An Asap consultant analyzes the job description,Relevant
"Then; he checks if there is an existing profile in the agency’s database,Relevant"
"If a matching profile has been found; the process to employ a candidate begins,Relevant"
"If the candidate has been employed; the process ends,Relevant"
"If he has not been employed; the consultant will recheck in the database in order to search for another potential profile,Relevant"
"If one is found; the loop is going again,Relevant"
If not an announcement is published on the agency site,Relevant
Moreover the consultant has to check the specificity of the job,Relevant
"Indeed; when the client wants a very specific candidate; the agency has to actively research a candidate in addition to the published announcement,Relevant"
"When the job does not require any specific skills; the consultant only needs to wait for candidates to propose themselves,Relevant"
"Whether it would be a specific or a non-specific job; when a candidate respondsto the announcement; the to employ a candidate process can start,Relevant"
"If the candidate has been employed; the process ends,Relevant"
"If the candidate has not been employed; the consultant researches or waits again for a candidate to answer the announcement,Relevant"
"However; if the agency can not find a candidate fast enough; the client must send a message to the agency to ask them to stop the process,Relevant"
"Indeed; the client works with several agencies so if another agency finds a candidate before Asap; the client has to warn Asap,Relevant"
"So; when Asap receives a message from the client; the agency must stop his searching process,Relevant"
The process starts when a profile of interim which matches with the announcement has been found,Relevant
The first step is to call the candidate for a phone screening,Relevant
"After the phone call; the candidate and the consultant agree for a date for a meeting,Relevant"
Another option is that the consultant realized during the phonescreening that the candidate was not suitable for the job,Relevant
"If so; the process ends,Relevant"
"If a meeting has been agreed; the consultant sends an email to the candidate with a confirmed date and some information over the meeting,Relevant"
"On the convenued day; the candidate goes to the meeting and the consultant rules the meeting,Relevant"
The meeting starts when the candidate arrives,Relevant
"So; the consultant can start the meeting,Irrelevant"
"Before discussing specific topics of the job; he has to check the candidate references,Relevant"
"After the discussion; the candidate has to pass a cognitive test,Relevant"
The meeting ends when he leaves,Relevant
"After the meeting; the consultant sends a report over the meeting to the client,Relevant"
Then they have to wait for the client to respond,Relevant
"When the client sends a feedback of the report to the agency; there are two possibilities,Relevant"
"On one hand; if the feedback is bad; the client does not want the candidate so the agency must send him a rejection message,Relevant"
"In this case; the process ends,Relevant"
"On the other hand; if the feedback is good; the client wants the candidate so the agency must send him an approval message,Relevant"
"After sending the message; the consultant makes the contract that he sends for the candidate to confirm and sign the contract,Relevant"
The candidate resends the signed contract to the agency which then sends the contract to the client,Relevant
"In this case; the candidate is employed and the process ends,Relevant"
"When the social secretary of ASAP receives the hours worked by the candidate for the client; the process can start,Relevant"
The first step is to inform the bank to pay the hours worked,Relevant
"When the bank receives the message from ASAP; she has to pay the worked hours to the candidate’s bank account,Relevant"
The candidate is then informed that he has received the payment,Relevant
The candidate checks if the payment is correct,Relevant
"If it is the case; the process is fulfilled,Relevant"
"If it is not; he must inform the agency about the payment error,Relevant"
"On the side of the agency; if she doesn’t receive a message from the candidate; the process is fulfilled but; when a payment error message is received; the agency must check if the candidate has been paid too much or not enough paid,Relevant"
"When the candidate has not been paid enough; the bank has to pay the extra hours on the candidate bank account and the process is fulfilled,Relevant"
"If the candidate has been too much paid; the agency must request a refund from the candidate,Relevant"
"So; the candidate pays the hours not worked to the bank and the process ends,Relevant"
(We can imagine that the candidates would not send an error message if he has been paid too much,Irrelevant
However some of them do and ASAP counts on their honesty),Irrelevant
The process starts when an employee evaluation is needed,Relevant
The superior calls the employee,Relevant
They plan a meeting together,Relevant
"After the phone call; the superior sends an email with the confirmed date of the meeting,Relevant"
"On the said date; the employee goes to the meeting,Relevant"
"So; the superior can start the meeting,Relevant"
He first checks if the KPIs of the employee are good,Relevant
"Then; he discusses with him about his general feeling in the company,Relevant"
"After that; the superior can end the meeting,Relevant"
"When the meeting is finished and the employee is left; the superior makes a feedback that he sends to his employee,Relevant"
"From there; there are three possibilities,Relevant"
Either the feedback is good so nothing happens or it is the first bad feedback so the superior warns his employee or it is the second bad feedback so the superior sends a breach of contract to his employee,Relevant
"After each possibility; the process ends,Relevant"
(We can surely say that the breach of the contract can be negotiated depending on the circumstances),Irrelevant
"When the agency has given a service to one of his clients; a consultant makes an invoice,Relevant"
The business manager then checks the invoice,Relevant
(The invoice may not be correct if the client has had a credit note on a past delivery),Irrelevant
"If the invoice is not correct; the business manager resends the invoice to the consultant and he has to make the invoice again,Relevant"
"If the invoice is correct; the consultant can send the invoice to the client,Relevant"
"When the invoice has been sent; the consultant waits for the payment,Relevant"
"If the payment arrives within 5 days; the process is fulfilled,Relevant"
"If it is not the case; the consultant calls the client with a first warning,Relevant"
"After this call; if the payment has been completed within 5 days; the process ends,Relevant"
"If not; the account manager calls the client for a second warning,Relevant"
The client has to pay within 5 days to finish the process if not the account manager sends an email about a potential bailiff venue and informs the bailiff about his potential venue,Relevant
"To finish the process; there are two possibilities,Relevant"
Either the client pays his debt within 50 days and the process ends or the account manager contacts the bailiff and the process is finished,Relevant
(the delays are so short because ASAP has to pay the temporary workers one week after the last day of the mission As mentioned above),Irrelevant
"The process starts with the interest of the client in finding a solution to the digital transformation his company needs; the first task is to propose and describe the 3 Bizz Online packs; get a response from the client; charge him and inform DJM,Relevant"
"The first contact always starts within Proximus stores; but the salesman only acts as an intermediate and only during the selling phase; after fulfilling the order he steps out of the conversation and an employee of DJM takes this over; firstly the manager,Relevant"
"The process starts when a customer enters a Proximus shop; either the customer goes to a Proximus shop because he is a freelancer interested in the Bizz online packs; or the seller proposes the Bizz online packs to him,Relevant"
"If the customer refuses the offer; the process is over,Relevant"
"On the other hand; if the customer is interested in the pack; the seller offers him the choice between 3 packs: S-M-L,Relevant"
"These packs are categorized according to their size; options and functionality,Irrelevant"
They go from the most basic to the most specific,Irrelevant
"Once the customer has made his choice; the seller informs a DJM manager of the customer's new request via an ERP system set up between the 2 companies: DJM and Proximus,Relevant"
Bizz online employees then start a discussion with the customer in order to prepare the website as well as possible,Relevant
"When the website is prepared; it is sent to the customer; who can then request the latest changes if he wants before the website is published,Relevant"
"If the client is satisfied with the website; it is published on the internet and the process is completed,Relevant"
"If the customer does not respond to the message sent within 5 days; a reminder message is sent,Relevant"
This process starts when the client (who has already chosen either the M -pack or the L-pack) is interested in receiving an e-shop as an option in his pack,Relevant
"After invoicing in a Proximus shop; the request of the client goes to a project manager of Bizz online who gets in touch with the client so that they can discuss the project,Relevant"
"Then; it’s the webmaster who produces the e-shop taking into account the suggestions of the client and does the modifications if necessary,Relevant"
This process ends when the e-shop is published,Relevant
The process starts when the manager receives a complaint,Relevant
He then registers it and transfers it to the webmaster,Relevant
"The webmaster analyses the complaint and if more information is needed; he recontacts the client to receive the missing pieces of information,Relevant"
"If he can resolve it directly; he skips those steps and resolves it,Relevant"
Then the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when a jobseeker sends his or her application to DJM by e-mail,Relevant
"The project manager receives the application and checks whether it contains the CV and covering letter; whether it contains the basic data such as name and surname; and whether the applicant has the required diploma to work at DJM,Relevant"
"If the documents are incomplete; the project manager will inform the applicant,Relevant"
"If the documents are complete; the project manager will contact the applicant through one of the channels provided on the CV to find a time to place an interview,Relevant"
"After the interview; if the candidate is hired; the project manager will send a rejection email,Relevant"
"After the interview; if the candidate is hired; an email is also sent to inform him/her of the news,Relevant"
The project manager then begins to enter the information collected from the application,Relevant
"If he/she notices that he/she is missing data; he/she contacts the candidate again to complete the application with the missing data,Relevant"
"Then he creates the contract; which he then sends,Relevant"
The process starts when an employee is needed,Relevant
"Then; the first task is made by the Head of department; who has to give specific criteria of the job (requirements; skills needed…),Relevant"
"Once the task is completed; the HR employee has to see if it is a specific/more special demand; or not,Relevant"
"Usually for nurses; they will look at spontaneous applications on the hospital website,Relevant"
"For more specific functions; they will externalize the process and recruit via Forum,Relevant"
"For more special requests (for example: energy engineer); they make an offer on the website themselves,Relevant"
"After having collected the CV; the HR employee has to to make a selection based on the head of department’s criteria,Relevant"
"If there are a lot of applications; he can decide to filter the candidates by doing a written exam in order to screen people,Relevant"
"Due to the written exam; he has to select candidate and review application,Relevant"
"Once the task is completed; he has to decide if he approve or not the candidate,Relevant"
"If he didn’t approve it; a rejection email will be sent to the applicant and the process is finished,Relevant"
"In the other case; the HR employee will have to schedule an online interview,Relevant"
"The head of the department has to conduct the personal interview and based on that; he will decide if he hire or not the candidate,Relevant"
If he doesn’t want to hire him or her a rejection email is sent to the candidate and the process is finished,Relevant
"In the other case; the head of department has to inform the HR employee that the applicant is hired,Relevant"
"Finally; the HR employee has to create an administrative file with the applicant’s information and create the employment contract,Relevant"
Once the tasks are completed the process is finished (= applicant employed),Relevant
The process takes place in emergencies,Irrelevant
It starts when a patient arrives at the emergency room,Relevant
"The emergency service has to register the patient and take his or her vital parameters as blood; pressure and so on,Relevant"
"These data are entered in the DPI system by the emergency service; which allows the doctor; even if he is not on site to consult that information,Relevant"
The doctor specialist has to check the patient’s data,Relevant
"based on that; he has to evaluate the urgency,Relevant"
"If he considers that it is not urgent; he has to give instructions to the emergency doctor,Relevant"
"Then the emergency doctor has to treat the patient; schedule an appointment and discharge him or her,Relevant"
"Once the tasks are completed; the process is finished,Relevant"
"In the other case; which means that the doctor specialist considers that it is an urgency; he has to inform the nurses and check bed availability at the same time,Relevant"
Nurses will then register the person in their department,Relevant
They absolutely have to have the approval of the medical specialist before they admit someone,Relevant
They cannot register a patient without that,Irrelevant
"Finally; the nurses have to move the patient from the emergency room to the room service,Relevant"
The process starts when medications are needed,Relevant
The first task is made by the nurse who has to check their department’s drug needs for each patient,Relevant
"The nurse then group everything together and send the order by fax; usually to the pharmacy,Relevant"
"In all hospitals; there is a pharmacy; so orders are sent there and directly processed,Relevant"
The pharmacy checks if they have everything (usually they have everything),Relevant
"If some medications are missing; they have to inform the nurse of the product’s non-availability,Relevant"
"Then; they have to check the availability of the medications in another service; and send someone to take them,Relevant"
"Once they have received the medications; they have to notify the nurse; prepare all the medications and finally deliver them to the nurse,Relevant"
"The last task is made by the nurse; who has to prepare the medications for each patient,Relevant"
"Once the task is done; the process is finished (= medications prepared),Relevant"
There are several possible cases:,Irrelevant
#NAME?
"If the dis missal is sufficiently justified; HR will take care of giving notice,Relevant"
- In the event of a decision to discontinue (e,Relevant
redirection to another hospital) It is up to the employee to request advance notice,Relevant
HR will ensure that the notice period is acceptable,Relevant
"This process especially concerns the Meuse Tube Clinic in Flémalle; this clinic belongs to the CHBA group,Irrelevant"
"However; the process cannot be the same as in Seraing,Irrelevant"
"When a patient wishes to make an appointment; he can do so through three different channels; this can be done by phone; by mail; or on the spot at the counter,Relevant"
"In all three cases; the patient will come across the reception desk of the clinic,Relevant"
"However; if it is done by e-mail; it may take longer to get an answer,Irrelevant"
"The receptionist will look at the places available and suggest an appointment date to the patient; then; an appointment will be scheduled,Relevant"
The person at the reception desk will then check his or her contact details via his or her identity card and health insurance,Relevant
"The patient has to pay directly on the spot; he will eventually receive an invoice,Relevant"
"After waiting in the waiting room; the doctor sees the patient,Relevant"
"He will check the ""patient's medical history"" in the CPR (computerized patient record); examine the patient and give recommendations for treatment,Relevant"
"Eventually; the doctor may request additional tests if the situation requires it or even transfer the patient to the emergency room in case of an emergency,Relevant"
He can also schedule a hospitalization if he wants to follow the patient in real time,Relevant
"The invoicing service will take care of the invoice which will depend on the technical services performed during the consultation; the status of the person and his or her health insurance company,Relevant"
The maintenance and repair process uses one main software : Carpark,Irrelevant
"Indeed; Carpark allows the management of all the vehicles from all the parks thanks to its database that includes all the information necessary about the vehicles from all the subsidiaries : the number plate; the intern references; but also the location of the maintenance; the maintenance plan that suits the vehicle the most according to the recommendation of the suppliers; … Moreover; drivers also use Carpark in order to encode the kilometers travelled with the busses; which allows the automated planning of the maintenance every 15 000 or 30 000 kilometers; depending on the bus,Relevant"
Those planned maintenances are sorted 1 500 kilometers in advance by the software in order for the technical and maintenance head to be able to plan their actual execution with the mechanics,Relevant
"Of course; more completion dates can be added manually in accordance with a specific date of a specific number of kilometers travelled,Relevant"
"Lastly; Carpark keeps the history of all the maintenances and repairs that have been done on each vehicle,Relevant"
The repair process starts with the transmission of a complaint through Carpark,Relevant
"With this complaint; a driver signals a damage (a breakdown or an accident) after having made a research with the number of the vehicle in order to verify that the damage has not already been signaled and avoid any duplication,Relevant"
"The content of the complaint is the following : the problem; the vehicle concerned; its kilometers travelled; and; if the driver wants to; his email address or his phone number in order to receive a message when the complaint is taken in charge,Irrelevant"
The technical and maintenance head can consult the list of all the complaints in Carpark,Irrelevant
"He then decides of the moment the complaint has to be treated ; depending on the urgency of the problem,Relevant"
"If the problem is considered as urgent; the technical and maintenance head directly visits the garage where the repair is going to be done in order to find mechanics who are available to take the bus in charge,Relevant"
"Otherwise; the repair is planned for a later day and will be taken in charge during the daily morning meeting between the technical and maintenance head and the mechanics where the work of the day is divided up,Relevant"
The technical and maintenance head creates the workshop sheet related to each repair,Relevant
"This sheet includes a description of the problem as well as the work that has to be done by the mechanics; and is identified by a specific codebare,Irrelevant"
"If the driver who transmitted the complaint gave a phone number or an email address; a message is automatically sent to him when the workshop sheet is created in order to let him know that the complaint is taken into account and that the bus is sent to the garage for repairs,Relevant"
"Following the daily planning of the mechanics; the technical and maintenance head sends the workshop sheets to the ones concerned by the repair,Relevant"
"With the use of a clocking software ; each mechanic scans the barcode of the workshop sheet to indicate when he takes it in charge; and then when he is done with the execution of its content,Relevant"
"That enables the technical and maintenance head to know which repairs are ongoing and which ones are finished; but also to know the workforce that has been required for each of them,Irrelevant"
"Moreover; the mechanic indicates in the workshop sheet every piece that he used for the repair by scanning the barcode of them (which also allows an easy following of the evolution of the stock),Relevant"
"Once the mechanic has finished the repairs; the completed workshop sheet is sent back to the technical and maintenance head who closes it,Relevant"
That finally permits the creation of the invoice as well as the suppression of the complaint in the list in Carpark,Relevant
"Of course; in order to make repairs on busses; it is essential to have efficient stock maintenance of the pieces required for those repairs,Irrelevant"
"It is the role of the technical and maintenance head to create the purchase orders; communicate them to the suppliers; take the delivery; control and approve the invoices,Relevant"
"Once a new piece arrives; either it is immediately used because it has been ordered for a specific repair that is ongoing or urgent; or the piece enters the stock,Relevant"
"Each piece of the stock is identified by a particular barcode (which is also useful to keep track of the pieces used during each repair; as mentioned previously); and has a particular place in the warehouse determined by a departement; a shelf and a level,Relevant"
"Keolis Belgium and its subsidiaries owns many gas stations with their fuel pumps; but they also manage the tankage of other stations in areas where they don’t own any cistern,Irrelevant"
"This mix of their own tanks and the external tanks is centralized in one software; Telenaro ; where the internal tanks are continuously updated; and the data from their external clients are imported two times a month,Relevant"
"Telenaro gathers all the societies; vehicles of the group; internal and external drivers; and data related : type of vehicle; maximum level of the fuel tank; baseline consumption; current consumption; and all the other details linked with the tankage,Relevant"
"That permits automated statistics about the consumption of fuel; as a way of efficient control despite the size of the entire group and the number of stations; vehicles and cisterns,Relevant"
"Moreover; the forecasting of the resupply of each cistern is based on an estimated range computed from the average daily consumption registered,Relevant"
"Lastly; Telenaro keeps the history of all the deliveries of fuel; the deltas given by the probes (see further); the alerts from problems during a delivery; etc,Relevant"
Any anomaly in Telenaro can be corrected manually by an operator,Relevant
A new system of probes installed in some of the cisterns of the company gives an on-live view of the fuel level,Relevant
"In parallel to the probes; the level is also computed from the documented tanks and resupplies in Telenaro,Relevant"
"The delta between the probed level and the computed one allows the operators to identify any problems in the supply of fuel or in the tankage of some vehicles (i.e. the amount of fuel delivered do not correspond to the one indicated on the invoice of the supplier ; a driver tries to defraud by taking some fuel for its 7 own personal consumption ; in winter; a quite big difference can come from the high consumption of the heaters for the scholar cars ; …),Irrelevant"
"The probe of a cistern also detects if the amount of fuel varies whereas no delivery is ongoing because of a leak of fuel or a theft; which triggers an alarm,Relevant"
It even gives the level of water in the cistern (due to the condensation in the cisterns) so that the operators know when they need to evacuate some of that water,Relevant
"Most importantly; the probes replace the previously needed and costly physical presence of an operator in order to verify and control the proper conduct of each resupply,Relevant"
The starting point of the resupply of a cistern is its low level of fuel,Irrelevant
"To know if any tankage is required; the manager of a society can easily visualize the level of each cistern of its society thanks to Telenaro and its icons and colored level bars (see the adjacent illustration),Irrelevant"
"In addition; the system automatically sends an alert to the manager when a particular level of fuel is reached whereas no tankage is planned yet,Relevant"
"When the operator decides that an order is needed ; he calls for tenders; and the best price gets the order,Relevant"
Then the manager makes the order to the supplier and sends an email to the subsidiaries in order to inform the local managers of the upcoming resupply,Relevant
All the ongoing orders are also registered in Telenaro,Relevant
"When the delivery man arrives at the location of the delivery; the operator in charge at the station gives him the delivery probe that has to be scanned at the pump to allow the tankage as well as to confirm to Telenaro that the delivery is made,Relevant"
"After the tankage; the delivery man encodes the amount of fuel he just delivered; and the system will compare that amount to the one measured by the probe,Relevant"
"If they do not correspond; the system asks the delivery man to re-encode the amount and makes the verification again,Relevant"
"After three times asking for re-encodage; if the encoded amount and the probed amount still do not correspond; the system sends a message to the firm in order to signal it,Relevant"
"Then; the delivery is confirmed by the system to the operator in charge as well as to Telenaro,Relevant"
"The system automatically creates and sends the invoice to the society that benefited from the delivery; and a copy to the manager in charge so that he is able to control if the delivery corresponds to the negotiations made at the moment of the ordering,Relevant"
It also generates the excise documents for the recovering as well as the official declaration for the Ministry,Relevant
"When an operator from any department wants to make a purchase; he has to fill in an investment request,Relevant"
Four different investment requests are used in Keolis Belgium for :,Relevant
"? Rolling stock (buses for regular lines; scholar lines; tourisms; but also trailers for the luggages;…),Relevant"
"? No-rolling stock (supplies for the garages; tools; compressors;…),Relevant"
"? Properties (buildings; but also air-conditioning; garage doors; led lights; bus wash;…),Relevant"
"? IT infrastructures (cabling; laptops; desktops; servers; magnetic access cards; surveillance cameras;,Relevant"
See the annexes for samples of the four investment requests,Irrelevant
"Once the investment request is completed; the amount of the expense is controlled by the purchase department regarding the budgetization of the year,Relevant"
"If the management validates the purchase; the investment request has now to be signed by the supervisor of the departments concerned by the purchase as well as a head of the purchase department in order to acknowledge the validation of the purely budgetary aspect,Relevant"
"Once the investment request has been signed; it is sent via email to the supplier that launches the delivery,Relevant"
"In order to close the process; the invoice still has to be validated by the purchase department that confirms the purchase,Relevant"
"The firm has a few master contracts with some suppliers; and all the subsidiaries are strongly encouraged to make their purchases through those master contracts as a priority,Irrelevant"
"Of course; case-by-case exceptions are possible but this tolerance toward the appeal to other suppliers is supervised : if a department constantly makes purchases with other suppliers that the ones concerned by the master contracts negotiated by the organisation; an operational manager or an head of the subsidiary will make sure it stops,Relevant"
"In fact; 76% of the purchases of the organisation are made within master contracts,Irrelevant"
"For example; all the OPEX (Operational Expenditures) that concern office supplies are subject to master contracts,Irrelevant"
"If no master contract concerns the purpose of the purchase and if the amount if that purchase exceeds 5 000 euros; three offers generally have to be collected before making a choice of a supplier; in order to compare the price-quality ratios; the delivery time; the quality of the after-sales service; etc,Relevant"
"(here again; exceptions are of course possible),Irrelevant"
The final choice of a supplier is made by the purchase department in tandem with the ones who will benefit from the purchase,Relevant
"Besides those master contracts; the company also has some price conventions and other pre-negotiated purchase terms with some other suppliers,Irrelevant"
"Whenever the company wants to broaden the number of clients it reaches; the very first step concerns the work of the marketing team,Relevant"
The aim is to get information about potential clients in order to determine if the company can propose valuable services to them and conclude an order,Irrelevant
This preparation is essential because it is the foundation of the sale process : the sales representatives from the commercial team have to be well prepared for the coming negotiation,Irrelevant
"Once the information has been collected through market analysis; the commercial team contacts the potential client and a first negotiation takes place,Relevant"
"The aim is to determine whether the client is interested by the potential offer; and the sales representative bases its argumentation on the client analysis previously communicated by the marketing department,Relevant"
"After the negotiation and if the client is indeed interested; a first offer is created,Relevant"
"This offer needs to be signed by several managers : if the offer is not appropriated; it might compromise the sale,Relevant"
"After having been signed; the offer is sent to the client by email,Relevant"
"If the client directly accepts the offer; the sale is validated and the processes of invoicing and delivering can start,Relevant"
"But if the client is not entirely satisfied with the proposition; more negotiations can take place in order to have the approval of the client; while still respecting the frames and goals from the management,Relevant"
"Repeating the last circle several times would be very heavy due to the long approbation chain ; but that almost never occurs : generally; if the second offer is still not validated by the client; the sale is cancelled,Relevant"
"Empty bottles are returned by the customers; once the bottles are received we sort the types of bottles before washing them afterwards; we control the cleanliness of the bottles and the quality of the bottles with a laser to detect the slightest defect,Relevant"
"If the bottles have defects; they are rejected and if not; they are kept,Relevant"
"Then the bottles are filled; captured; labelled and marked with the expiry date,Relevant"
Then the bottles go to the warehouse for storage,Relevant
AB Inbev needs bottles so they will order the bottles from their suppliers,Relevant
"The suppliers check the order if it is accepted; a confirmation is sent to AB Inbev; then the suppliers plan the transportation; then they send the invoice and at the same time the bottles are delivered by truck to AB Inbev,Relevant"
"Once the trucks are received; AB Inbev unload the trucks and then they check the goods; if everything is good; the bottles are stored; if not; AB Inbev sends the bad products back to the suppliers and the suppliers will send a new invoice and the good products or missing products to AB Inbev who will unload the trucks; check the goods before storing them,Relevant"
"purchase order is received at the logistics department; if it is a new customer; it has to be entered into the VPO System which is used by all AB Inbev breweries,Relevant"
"The VPO manager will then send the order information to the warehouse; which will then check the availability of the beer for the order,Relevant"
"If everything is available; the order is prepared; otherwise a request is sent to the packaging department to produce the missing beer,Relevant"
"Once the beer is ready; it is delivered and the invoice is sent to the customer,Relevant"
"AB InBev receives unsolicited applications but also via other channels (Indeed and Forem); the People department receives applications,Relevant"
"1. CV screening consists of the elimination of CVs that do not meet the criteria requested by the company; and when information is missing we send an e-mail to warn the candidate,Relevant"
"If they do not meet the criteria; their application will not have been selected,Relevant"
2. The telephone interview: the recruiter will contact the selected candidates by telephone (5-10 minutes),Relevant
"If he is convinced; he will invite the candidate to the recruitment morning,Relevant"
"3. The recruitment morning is a collective interview; there is a series of tests,Relevant"
Successful candidates are contacted by telephone to invite them to the next interview with the N+1 or N+2,Relevant
4. Interview with the department manager : The manager turns his interview more towards the personality of the candidate,Relevant
"If the candidate is accepted; he or she is invited to a training course,Relevant"
"5. Form’Alim"" training: Form’Alim is a training course specially created for production operators in the food industry,Irrelevant"
"6. The first ""seasonal"" contract and coaching: When signing the contract; the candidate is invited to the People Department to complete documents,Relevant"
"7. The permanent contract: If the employee receives a sufficient number of positive feedbacks; his manager is satisfied with his work and ABI has the opportunity to do so; he will be offered a permanent contract,Relevant"
Different types of malts are put together in the tank,Relevant
They are crushed in order to extract the fermentable sugar,Relevant
The resulting product is then mixed with heated water in a vat,Relevant
Then the liquid is pumped into another tank in which the husks of the grains are separated from the suicidal liquid,Relevant
The liquid obtained is then subjected to strong heat in a kettle,Relevant
"After this step; we will be able to proceed to the fermentation process: we will add hops and yeast which will convert the sugar into beer; then we will cool the beer; filter it and add CO2 to make the beer sparkling,Relevant"
So all that remains is to wait until the beer is mature (3 weeks) before it can be sold and consumed,Relevant
"The aim of this process is to answer; positively or not; to an employee’s holiday request,Irrelevant"
The process starts when an employee makes a request which is received by a human resource analyst,Relevant
"The analyst takes charge of the request by changing its state to « pending »; which means that the demand is neither approved nor rejected,Relevant"
"Then; the request is sent to the manager of the requester’s department,Relevant"
This is the first step that the request has to go through,Irrelevant
"If the manager rejects the request; the analyst changes its state to « rejected » and the process ends with a notification sent to the employee,Relevant"
"Otherwise; if the manager accepts the request; the analyst changes the state of the request to « approved » and the first step is done,Relevant"
"After that; the request also has to be granted by the human resource manager,Relevant"
The aim of this process is to allocate human resources to a specific task,Irrelevant
"To understand it properly; it is common sense yet important to note a human resource cannot be assigned to a project if this one doesn’t already exist,Irrelevant"
"In the same way; we cannot create a project before having a customer to which it relates,Irrelevant"
"So in the most common cases; the manager will want to allocate a human resource to a specific project; so he is going to trigger the process by its higher start event,Relevant"
"Then; he is going to create and fulfill the new resource page and add it on the project,Relevant"
That leads straightly to the higher end event and this is the shortest way to go through the process,Relevant
"Otherwise; if; after trying to create this page; the software realizes that this new resource doesn’t refer to an existing project; the process leads the analyst to the creation of this one,Relevant"
This is the role of the first gateway,Irrelevant
"After successfully filling each step; the process brings back the analyst on the first line and to the first end event,Relevant"
"In the same way; if; during the creation of a new project; the software realizes that this project doesn’t relate to a registered customer; then the process leads the analyst in the encoding of this new customer,Relevant"
This is the role of the purple gateway,Irrelevant
"After having registered this new customer; the process brings the employee back to the second and then to the first line that leads again to the first end event,Relevant"
Of course we could imagine the case where the analyst would only want to create a new project or to register a new customer without immediately allocating a resource to it,Irrelevant
"This is the role of the second and the third start events; which respectively leads to the second and third end events,Irrelevant"
This business process is triggered when the training manager wants to create a training,Relevant
"If the training has not already been taught in the past; then the manager has to create a whole new training,Relevant"
(cfr linked subprocess),Irrelevant
"Otherwise; the manager only has to schedule the session of related training (called then a session) and contact the external trainer of his choice; specialized in this field,Relevant"
"As the attendance needs to be recorded for obvious financial and organizational reasons; the manager establishes a list of attendees thanks to the form sent earlier on and the IT training system,Relevant"
"1 week before the training’s day; a reminder is sent by email to the attendees,Relevant"
"After the session; the manager has to perform 3 tasks simultaneously: ask for a debrief; apply the post-training process and update attendees’ skills in the database,Relevant"
"That being done; the whole process finally ends,Relevant"
"Subprocess : If a training has not been given yet on a particular subject in the past; the manager has to design the training and fill a form with the details of it,Relevant"
"If the HR director does not accept the training framework for various reasons (the training being too expensive; too time-consuming for the human resources etc); the manager has to re-evaluate it and redesign the training,Relevant"
"Otherwise; the manager can select the language the training will be given in (French; English or both),Relevant"
"Finally; he has to save the choices made before and this creates the training in their IT training system,Relevant"
This BPMN is relative to the internal invoicing and the payment of an internal contract,Irrelevant
It happens when an entity of the group ARHS offers its services to another entity,Relevant
The accounting officer of the entity providing its services receives the “framework” which is the name given to an internal contract from the indebted entity’s accounting department,Relevant
The latter selects lines corresponding to the framework and records it in “Interco” which is the software used for internal contracts,Relevant
"After that; the accounting officer clicks on the button “send to invoice” and the invoice is registered as “to be received” in “FICO” which is the general accountancy software,Relevant"
"Finally; the accounting officer waits for the payment and sends a reminder after 30 days of waiting to the indebted entity,Relevant"
They do not charge any kind of late fees to each other as they are all part of the same group,Irrelevant
"Once it is received; the invoice gets archived,Relevant"
"If the company finds an interesting profile; the HR employee searches for information about them; creates a proposal; and sends them an email,Relevant"
"If the person rejects the proposal or does not respond to it within three weeks; the process ends,Relevant"
"However; if they accept the proposal; the human resources employee calls them to set up a meeting a week later,Relevant"
"Once the interview has been made; the HR employee arranges a visit to the company for a moment later,Relevant"
"Once the visit and the interview have been carried out; a skills test for the potential future employee has to be taken,Relevant"
"Depending on their result; the company decides whether to hire them or not,Relevant"
"If the answer is yes; the company considers a contract proposal and calls the candidate to discuss it,Relevant"
The company is then awaiting for their response,Relevant
The latter can accept or refuse the contract,Irrelevant
"If the answer is negative; a new call is scheduled to renegotiate the employment clauses,Relevant"
"If accepted; the employee is hired and their profile is registered in the company system,Relevant"
Another way to get into the hiring process is to apply through an online form on the company website or to spontaneously apply to the company,Relevant
"In the first case; the documents of the applicants; their CV and the online form will be analyzed by a human resources employee,Relevant"
"In the second case; the employee will only analyze the documents and CVs of the applicants,Relevant"
"Based on these documents; the employee decides whether or not to go on with the process by calling the candidate if selected,Relevant"
The process starts when a message from the MRP system2 is received,Relevant
"Indeed; to manufacture a pump for a customer; they need material resources; and the MRP system knows it so it sends notifications to the central purchasing department that will then take care of this information,Relevant"
"Then; three activities have to be done in parallel: • Create an X-Flow3 • Request for quotation to the supplier • Do a framework agreement price matrix (it is done to calculate costs of the pump),Relevant"
"When these 3 tasks are completed; the company places an order with its supplier who then takes care of the delivery,Relevant"
Then the product is sent to the quality control to check the quality of the products received,Relevant
"If the quality does not meet the expectations; they are sent back to the supplier and the supplier delivers better products or does some repairs on them,Relevant"
"If the quality is good; they are sent to the Central purchasing department with the invoice,Relevant"
"When the invoice is received; they have to validate the invoice in order to confirm that everything is ok and matches the information in the X-Flow; which allows the accounting department to free up money and the process ends like this,Relevant"
The process starts when the planning department receives a sales order from the customer,Relevant
They are then able to prepare a preliminary planning and to give feedback to the project manager for the kick-off meeting (KOM),Relevant
"Then; the master planner attends the KOM and; thanks to the minutes of meeting (MOM) that he receives by mail; he can update the planning and save a deadlines baseline that contains all the project’s milestones,Relevant"
The planning department can then launch the production order by putting it into the SAP system,Relevant
"Then; meetings take place each week until the end of the production,Relevant"
"In case there are delays due to some modifications in the plan of the pump or delays due to late deliveries from the supplier; the project manager is informed and he gives this information to the planning department,Relevant"
The planning is then updated,Relevant
The whole company is supposed to follow this planning and to act according to it,Irrelevant
The process ends when the pump is done,Relevant
The process starts when an idea of conception comes to the mind of somebody in the business unit,Relevant
"Then the business unit makes a project proposal; and a detailed analysis is done,Relevant"
Then the product development team does the technical specifications and after that the stakeholders make an analysis of the product and decide whether it is feasible or not,Relevant
"If they say that it is infeasible; the process ends,Relevant"
"But if it is feasible; then the business unit; the product development team and the operations and procurement team meet during a kick-off meeting to talk about the project,Relevant"
"Then; those three teams work together in order to make a deeper analysis and conceptual generic drawings,Relevant"
"Then; they still work together to set up a detailed drawing with technical specifications this time,Relevant"
"When those tasks are done; the product development team realises final manufacturing drawings with all the composing parts,Relevant"
Then the three teams above-mentioned have to gather all the data to put it in the manufacturing file,Relevant
"After all these activities; the pump is ready to be sold so the product development team puts it in the product catalogue and the process ends,Relevant"
The process starts when the production order is received from the SAP system,Relevant
The workers can then take the raw parts needed for a specific pump in the warehouse,Relevant
"When it is done; they send a notification to inform the SAP system that this step of the production is done,Relevant"
Then the system sends a work order to the workers in the machining service and two activities are done in parallel : the transformation of raw parts that is done by the workers and the one that is done by the subcontractor,Relevant
"When all the pieces are transformed by the subcontractor or by the workers; they can store those finished materials in the warehouse and once again inform the SAP system,Relevant"
Then they receive another work order from SAP to pre-assemble the pump,Relevant
"When it is done; they store the subsets and inform SAP,Relevant"
"Once again they receive a work order; and they have to do two activities in parallel : do the piping and assemble the bareshaft pump4,Relevant"
"Then when those two activities are done; they can assemble the final pump and check its performance thanks to an internal and an external quality controller,Relevant"
"If the performance is of good quality; the pump is dispatched,Relevant"
A notification is then sent to SAP and the process ends,Relevant
"If the performance is poor; they solve the problem and then they check again if it is ok,Relevant"
The process starts when the customer notifies a problem to the after-sales department,Relevant
They receive the defective material at the plant and they create a file,Relevant
"Then; they are able to estimate a quote,Relevant"
The next step is assessing the problem,Relevant
"If the problem comes from the customer; the warranty will not be applied but if the company is responsible for it; the customer will have to pay nothing for the repairs,Relevant"
"In the case where the customer is under warranty; they apply it,Relevant"
"If he is not under warranty; a final quote is set up and the customer has to accept or to reject it,Relevant"
"If he rejects the quote; the file is closed and the material is sent back,Relevant"
"The company can still charge him for the time they spent on the pump; so they can also create an invoice before sending back the material,Relevant"
"In the case where he accepts the quote; or right after having applied the warranty; they create a work order (WO),Relevant"
Then they get the material they need to do the repairs thanks to the central purchasing,Relevant
Then they have to consider if those are small or big repairs,Relevant
"If a big repair has to be done; they go on site to do it because of practical reasons; then they create the invoice and the process ends,Relevant"
"If it is only small repairs; they do it at Sulzer’s workshop and then they send back the material,Relevant"
"Once it is done; they create the invoice and the process ends,Relevant"
"Before really getting into the recruitment process; it is important to know that Resultance tries its best to approach young people,Irrelevant"
To do this Resultance is present in schools and on various recruitment sites to promote the company and attract young people,Irrelevant
The recruitment process takes place in several stages,Irrelevant
"Applications are received by the HR managers; who then sort and select the best applications,Relevant"
"Once an application is selected; an interview is set up between the candidate and the HR managers,Relevant"
Then the candidates selected after the first interview are interviewed by a partner of the firm,Relevant
"Once the candidate has been selected; the integration phase begins; the candidate will receive a salary package from the HR department; and a mentor will be appointed to supervise the new candidate and help him or her integrate as well as possible,Relevant"
A form is sent to all members of the firm to inform them of the arrival of a new employee,Relevant
"The integration process: On the first day; the employee is welcomed by the HR department and the administrative assistant,Relevant"
"The employee is given his or her work tools (mobile phone; PC; car) and is explained the IT tools used at Resultance,Relevant"
"They are told what they need to know about the firm; the company's values are explained to them and they receive their assignment,Relevant"
He will be attached to a project and will know the manager who is going to supervise it,Relevant
The welcome continues with the godfather or godmother over a meal to immediately create a relationship and ensure that the new employee is well integrated,Relevant
The employee is then monitored and supervised by his or her manager and feedback is given to ensure that he or she develops well,Relevant
"A diagnosis is launched at the customer's premises; an employee will describe the company; its level of performance in the different departments,Relevant"
Risks at the level of processes and organisation will be assessed,Relevant
The intensity of the changes will also be highlighted by the employees responsible for the diagnosis,Relevant
To do this Resultance uses the SWOT tool and focuses on the opportunities,Irrelevant
"Once the diagnosis has been established; the employees will share the findings and recommendations resulting from the client's analysis,Relevant"
"From this moment on; improvement paths will be described and will reveal the quantitative and qualitative gains that can be made,Relevant"
Then a member of staff will draw up a detailed action plan in the form of a gantt chart for each area of improvement,Relevant
"Once the diagnosis has been made; the areas for improvement put forward; it is up to the management team to decide whether or not to take action,Relevant"
The diagnosis will make it possible to define the duration of the mission and the number of employees required for the project,Relevant
"Based on this; an estimate can be drawn up and presented to the client,Relevant"
"Based on the investigation and on a formal decision taken by the management team; a project is launched,Relevant"
Resultance pursues the analysis of the client's company in order to gain credibility and establishes the collaborative relationship,Irrelevant
"The employees responsible for the project build new tools; propose new working methods and processes,Relevant"
Workshops are set up at the client's premises to directly involve stakeholders in the changes proposed by Resultance employees,Relevant
Each new proposal must be validated by the steering committee (responsible for ensuring that a project runs smoothly within a company),Relevant
The tools are then deployed in the field,Relevant
"In order to ensure that the methodologies are properly transformed into results; Resultance employees working at the client's site set up and lead the teams to ensure that the new tools are actually implemented,Relevant"
The teams are monitored until they reach the objectives set by Resultance,Relevant
This ensures a real collaborative relationship between Resultance and the client,Irrelevant
"To ensure that the project runs smoothly; a meeting is held once a week with the Resultance project manager and the client's internal project manager,Relevant"
"This makes it possible; for example; to resolve any problems immediately if there are any,Irrelevant"
"In addition to this; every 4 to 6 weeks; a steering committee (with the management committee of the client company) is set up to take stock of the actions carried out in the project; to take stock of progress and any problems encountered,Relevant"
This monitoring makes it possible to give new directions to the project or change priorities,Irrelevant
"And finally; Resultance ensures the proper transfer of knowledge and tools put in place to ensure sustainability,Relevant"
The client is then autonomous and benefits from continuous improvement,Irrelevant
"When a new employee joins the company; his or her objectives and expectations are entered into the database of a tool called ""Workday"",Relevant"
"This tool centralizes and automates all the decisions related to human resources management such as managing holidays and leaves; evaluations; sending reminder for deadlines and registering automated approvals,Relevant"
"In addition; this process requires little or no supervision,Irrelevant"
This process of human resources management ends when the employee leaves GSK,Relevant
"Once a customer has placed an order; the documents related to the purchase are received at the factory while the documents related to transport and the products (badge with date of production and expiry date) are handled manually,Relevant"
The warehouse verifies on paper that the data on the pallets is consistent with the order,Relevant
"Then; the papers are scanned and sent to the quality team,Relevant"
The quality team makes verifications before signing and archiving the file,Relevant
"After that; the products related to the order can be released,Relevant"
This process starts when a client requests a pricing offer to the local Belgian GSK team,Relevant
An employee receives the request and prepares a pricing offer,Relevant
"Then; according to the 4 eyes principle; another employee from the Belgian team checks the offer,Relevant"
"If there is a discrepancy; the offer is corrected,Relevant"
"When the offer is finally approved; it is sent to the central team in India to copy it in SAP,Relevant"
The central team signals that the offer is confirmed to the local Belgian team by email,Relevant
"When this email is received in Belgium; the offer is confirmed to the client,Relevant"
There are 3 possibilities for GSK to receive an order for their products from a customer:,Relevant
• The customer can place his order through a sales representative of GSK during a physical visit,Relevant
This case applies mainly to the pharmacies,Irrelevant
The representative encodes the order on a tablet connected to the GSK ordering system,Relevant
• The customer can also place orders by e-mailing the company,Relevant
"When the e-mail is received; the customer service checks the availability of the products ordered,Relevant"
The order is checked and sent to the warehouse if the items are in stock,Relevant
"In case of shortage; the customer is of course notified,Relevant"
• The third possibility consists in the customer using GSK’s platform thanks to a personal identifier interfaced with EDI (Electronic Data Interchange),Relevant
"Once the order is confirmed; it is sent to the warehouse,Relevant"
"After receiving the order; the warehouse verifies that the information is correct,Relevant"
"Then; a staff member in the warehouse picks up the different articles with a cart,Relevant"
"Once the products are picked up; they are boxed and packed,Relevant"
"Then; the order is placed on pallets to be delivered to the customer,Relevant"
The tracking of the order and the expected delivery time can be consulted at any time by the customer thanks to the label on the order,Irrelevant
"When the products are received by the customer; the invoice is sent,Relevant"
This process starts when a customer has a complaint about the price or the quantity of one order,Relevant
He or she has to contact the customer service,Relevant
"Even if the contact is made by phone; an e-mail has to be sent to have a written proof of the complaint,Relevant"
"Then; the customer service has to ask the sales manager if the correct price was applied/the right quantity was sent,Relevant"
"If it is; the process ends with sending an email of rejection of complaint to the costumer,Relevant"
"If the price/quantity is not correct; the customer service generates a credit note and send it to the sales manager who has to print-sign-scan before sending it back to the customer service,Relevant"
Then the customer service also has to print-sign-scan-send it and reimburse the customer,Relevant
The law obliges GSK to keep proof of the complaint for 7 years,Irrelevant
This storage is currently done through paper format documents,Irrelevant
There are two ways to find out something is missing,Irrelevant
"Due to the digital transformation; most of the inventory is automatically done at the end of the day,Irrelevant"
"So; every morning; the supply manager; when he sees the ERP alert; purchases the products missing (or practically missing),Relevant"
"The manager is constantly prospecting but if something is missing; he does not have the time to ask every supplier to make a quote; that is a support activity,Relevant"
The other way to find out something is missing is by a warehouse worker,Relevant
"Thanks to ERP; it is hardly happening,Irrelevant"
"But; if while he is picking products; something is missing or the quality is not good enough; he will directly alert the supply manager so he will purchase new ones,Relevant"
"Suppliers are listed in the “supplier database”; where the manager can retrieve which product is from which supplier,Irrelevant"
The invoice is finally sent to the financial department where it will be paid,Relevant
Most of the leads are firstly received by a telemarketer by mail or by a phone call,Relevant
They will take the information about the client and insert them into the “Customer database”,Relevant
We will assume that every lead is about B2B,Irrelevant
"If the client does not need delivery or a quote; he should go to the “cash and carry” shop in Droixhe,Relevant"
The telemarketer will then send the address of the delivery to receive a day of delivery for the client,Relevant
"If for some reason; the day proposed by the transporter does not suit the client; the financial department will analyze if it could; economically; be possible to charter a truck just for him,Relevant"
"If not; the lead will be aborted,Relevant"
"If the client agrees and does not need a physical appointment; the telemarketer will make a quote,Relevant"
"Otherwise; he will attribute the client to a salesman available who will set an appointment and make the quote,Relevant"
"When the first quote is made; by the salesman or the telemarketer; the client might refuse it or accept it,Relevant"
"If the client accepts it; the contract will be signed; and the order made,Relevant"
"If not; he might not be interested anymore and the case would be closed; or he might want a better quote,Relevant"
The salesman/telemarketer will need approval from the financial department to lower prices or make a promotion,Relevant
"If it is not possible to do a better quote; the case will be closed,Relevant"
"If it is; the salesman/telemarketer will make the new quote which might; once again; be approved or refused by the client,Relevant"
"And so on; until the client declined the offer or consented to it,Relevant"
"When the order arrived at the warehouse; if there are some products that need to be pre-commanded; the manager will do so; and the order will be handled as soon as delivered,Relevant"
"Otherwise; he will assign the order to an available worker,Relevant"
He will receive the order on his scanner,Relevant
It indicates the emplacement of products and their quantity,Irrelevant
"If the product needed is not there; the work must advise the manager so he can report the error; corrects the database; and purchases the product needed,Relevant"
"Every time the picker picks something; he must check the quality and the expiration date in order to avoid any return,Relevant"
"When all the products of the order are picked; the worker needs to check that the weight and the volume correspond to what is expected by the ERP,Relevant"
"Then; if everything is right; the worker will confirm the order and emit the shipment order,Relevant"
"If the order is canceled; the financial department will determine the cancelation penalty and charge it to the customer; and if the product was not shipped yet; the manager will handle the product return,Relevant"
"When the order is delivered; the transporter sends a delivery note to the financial department,Relevant"
"Then; every Monday; they emit the invoice for every customer delivered,Relevant"
"If after 14 days; they still do not have the payment; they will send a reminder,Relevant"
"If after another 14 days; the order is still unpaid; the debt recovery will start and the client will be stuck,Relevant"
The party sends a warrant possession request asking a warrant to be released,Relevant
The Client Service Back Office as part of the Small Claims Registry Operations receives the request and retrieves the SCT file,Relevant
"Then; the SCT Warrant Possession is forwarded to Queensland Police,Relevant"
The SCT physical file is stored by the Back Office awaiting a report to be sent by the Police,Relevant
"When the report is received; the respective SCT file is retrieved,Relevant"
"Then; Back Office attaches the new SCT document; and stores the expanded SCT physical file,Relevant"
"After that; some other MC internal staff receives the physical SCT file (out of scope),Relevant"
"As a basic principle; ACME AG receives invoices on paper or fax,Irrelevant"
These are received by the Secretariat in the central inbox and forwarded after a short visual inspection to an accounting employee,Relevant
"In ""ACME Financial Accounting""; a software specially developed for the ACME AG; she identifies the charging suppliers and creates a new instance (invoice),Relevant"
"She then checks the invoice items and notes the corresponding cost center at the ACME AG and the related cost center managers for each position on a separate form (""docket""),Relevant"
The docket and the copy of the invoice go to the internal mail together and are sent to the first cost center manager to the list,Relevant
He reviews the content for accuracy after receiving the copy of the invoice,Relevant
"Should everything be in order; he notes his code one on the docket (""accurate position - AP"") and returns the copy of the invoice to the internal mail,Relevant"
"From it; the copy of the invoice is passed on to the next cost center manager; based on the docket; or if all items are marked correct; sent back to accounting,Relevant"
"Therefore; the copy of invoice and the docket gradually move through the hands of all cost center managers until all positions are marked as completely accurate,Relevant"
"However; if inconsistencies exist; e.g. because the ordered product is not of the expected quantity or quality; the cost center manager rejects the AP with a note and explanatory statement on the docket; and the copy of the invoice is sent back to accounting directly,Relevant"
"Based on the statements of the cost center managers; she will proceed with the clarification with the vendor; but; if necessary; she consults the cost center managers by telephone or e-mail again,Relevant"
"When all inconsistencies are resolved; the copy of the invoice is sent to the cost center managers again; and the process continues,Relevant"
"After all invoice items are AP; the accounting employee forwards the copy of the invoice to the commercial manager,Relevant"
He makes the commercial audit and issues the approval for payment,Relevant
"If the bill amount exceeds EUR 20;000; the Board wants to check it again (4-eyes-principle),Relevant"
The copy of the invoice including the docket moves back to the accounting employee in the appropriate signature file,Relevant
"Should there be a complaint during the commercial audit; it will be resolved by the accounting employee with the supplier,Relevant"
"After the commercial audit is successfully completed; the accounting employee gives payment instructions and closes the instance in ""ACME financial accounting"",Relevant"
The loan approval process starts by receiving a customer request for a loan amount,Relevant
The risk assessment Web service is invoked to assess the request,Relevant
"If the loan is small and the customer is low risk; the loan is approved,Relevant"
"If the customer is high risk; the loan is denied,Relevant"
"If the customer needs further review or the loan amount is for $10;000 or more; the request is sent to the approver Web service,Relevant"
The customer receives feedback from the assessor or approver,Relevant
The process of Vacations Request starts when any employee of the organization submits a vacation request,Relevant
"Once the requirement is registered; the request is received by the immediate supervisor of the employee requesting the vacation,Relevant"
The supervisor must approve or reject the request,Relevant
"If the request is rejected; the application is returned to the applicant/employee who can review the rejection reasons,Relevant"
"If the request is approved a notification is generated to the Human Resources Representative; who must complete the respective management procedures,Relevant"
The process of Vacations Request starts when any employee of the organization submits a vacation request,Relevant
"Once the requirement is registered; the request is received by the immediate supervisor of the employee requesting the vacation,Relevant"
The supervisor must approve or reject the request,Relevant
If the request is rejected the process will end,Relevant
If the request is asked to make a change then it is returned to the petitioner/employee who can review the comments for the change request,Relevant
If the request is approved it will go to the purchase department that will be in charge of making quotations (using a subprocess) and select a vendor,Relevant
If the vendor is not valid in the system the purchase department will have to choose a different vendor,Relevant
"After a vendor is selected and confirmed; the system will generate and send a purchase order and wait for the product to be delivered and the invoice received,Relevant"
In any case the system will send a notification to let the user know what the result was,Relevant
"In any of the cases; approval; rejection or change required the system will send the user a notification,Relevant"
"First; the Manager checks the open leads,Relevant"
"Afterwards; he selects the top five ones,Relevant"
He then tells his Sales Assistant to call the contact person of the leads,Relevant
The Sales Assistant calls each customer,Relevant
"If someone is interested; he sends a note to the Manager,Relevant"
The Manager then processes the lead,Relevant
"Otherwise; he calls the next customer,Relevant"
The customer enters the withdrawal amount,Relevant
The ATM returns cash to the customer and changes his account balance,Relevant
"If the balance on customer’s account is less than the withdrawal amount; the ATM returns an error,Relevant"
"In a bowl; mix the lemon juice; olive oil; Dijon mustard; garlic; red bell pepper; salt; and pepper,Relevant"
Set aside 1/4 cup of the mixture to use for basting,Relevant
"Place chicken in the bowl; and marinate at least 20 minutes in the refrigerator,Relevant"
Preheat grill for high heat,Relevant
Lightly oil grill grate,Relevant
"Drain and discard marinade from the bowl; and place chicken on the grill,Relevant"
"Cook 6 to 8 minutes on each side; until juices run clear; basting occasionally with the reserved marinade,Relevant"
An employee purchases a product or service he requires,Relevant
"For instance; a sales person on a trip rents a car,Irrelevant"
"The employee submits an expense report with a list of items; along with the receipts for each item,Relevant"
A supervisor reviews the expense report and approves or rejects the report,Relevant
"Since the company has expense rules; there are circumstances where the supervisor can accept or reject the report upon first inspection,Irrelevant"
"These rules could be automated; to reduce the workload on the supervisor,Irrelevant"
"If the supervisor rejects the report; the employee; who submitted it; is given a chance to edit it;,Relevant"
for example to correct errors or better describe an expense,Irrelevant
"If the supervisor approves the report; it goes to the treasurer,Relevant"
The treasurer checks that all the receipts have been submitted and match the items on the list,Relevant
"If all is in order; the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing,Relevant"
"(including; e.g. payment or refund; and accounting),Irrelevant"
"If receipts are missing or do not match the report; he sends it back to the employee,Relevant"
"If a report returns to the employee for corrections; it must again go to a supervisor; even if the supervisor previously approved the report,Relevant"
"If the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing; the report moves to an automatic activity that links to a payment system,Relevant"
The process waits for the payment confirmation,Relevant
"After the payment is confirmed; the process ends,Relevant"
"Every time we get a new order from the sales department; first; one of my masters determines the necessary parts and quantities as well as the delivery date,Relevant"
"Once that information is present; it has to be entered into our production planning system (PPS),Relevant"
It optimizes our production processes and creates possibly uniform work packages so that the setup times are minimized,Relevant
"Besides; it creates a list of parts to be procured,Relevant"
"Unfortunately it is not coupled correctly to our Enterprise Resource Planning system (ERP); so the data must be transferred manually,Irrelevant"
"By the way; that is the second step,Irrelevant"
"Once all the data is present; we need to decide whether any parts are missing and must be procured or if this is not necessary,Relevant"
"Once production is scheduled to start; we receive a notice from the system and an employee takes care of the implementation,Relevant"
"Finally; the order will be checked again for its quality,Relevant"
The intake workflow starts with a notice by telephone at the secretarial office of the mental health care institute,Relevant
This notice is done by the family doctor of somebody who is in need of mental treatment,Irrelevant
The secretarial worker inquires after the name and residence of the patient,Relevant
"On the basis of this information; the doctor is put through to the nursing officer responsible for the part of the region that the patient lives in,Relevant"
"The nursing officer makes a full inquiry into the mental; health; and social state of the patient in question,Relevant"
This information is recorded on a registration form,Relevant
"At the end of the conversation; this form is handed in at the secretarial office of the institute,Relevant"
"Here; the information on the form is stored in the information system and subsequently printed,Relevant"
"For new patients; a patient file is created,Relevant"
The registration form as well as the print from the information system are stored in the patient file,Irrelevant
"At the secretarial office; two registration cards are produced for respectively the future first and second intaker of the patient,Relevant"
The new patient is added on the list of new notices,Relevant
"Halfway the week; at Wednesday; a staff meeting of the entire medical team takes place,Relevant"
"At this meeting; the team-leader assigns all new patients on the list of new notices to members of the team,Relevant"
"Each patient will be assigned to a social-medical worker; who will act as the first intaker of the patient,Irrelevant"
One of the physicians will act as the second intaker,Irrelevant
The assignments are recorded on an assignment list which is handed to the secretarial office,Relevant
"For each new assignment; it is also determined whether the medical file of the patient is required,Relevant"
This information is added to the assignment list,Relevant
The secretarial office stores the assignment of each patient of the assignment list in the information system,Relevant
It passes the produced registration cards to the first and second intaker of each newly assigned patient,Relevant
"For each patient for which the medical file is required; the secretarial office prepares and sends a letter to the family doctor of the patient; requesting for a copy of the medical file,Relevant"
"As soon as this copy is received; the secretarial office will inform the second intaker and add the copy to the patient file,Relevant"
The first intaker plans a meeting with the patient as soon as this is possible,Relevant
"During the first meeting; the patient is examined using a standard checklist which is filled out,Relevant"
Additional observations are registered in a personal notebook,Relevant
"After a visit; the first intaker puts a copy of these notes in the file of a patient,Relevant"
The standard checklist is also added to the patient's file,Relevant
The second intaker plans the first meeting only after the medical information of the physician – if required – has been received,Relevant
Physicians use dictaphones to record their observations made during meetings with patients,Relevant
"The secretarial office types out these tapes; after which the information is added to the patient file,Relevant"
"As soon as the meetings of the first and second intaker with the patient have taken place; the secretarial office puts the patient on the list of patients that reach this status,Relevant"
"For the staff meeting on Wednesday; they provide the team-leader with a list of these patients,Relevant"
"For each of these patients; the first and second intaker together with the team-leader and the attending psychiatrist formulate a treatment plan,Relevant"
This treatment plan formally ends the intake procedure,Relevant
At the beginning the customer perceives that her subscribed service has degraded,Relevant
A list with all the problem parameters is then sent to the Customer Service department of TELECO,Relevant
At the customer service an employee enters,Relevant
(based on the received data),Irrelevant
a problem report into system T,Relevant
Then the problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are,Relevant
"Based on this; the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities,Relevant"
An electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship,Relevant
"In case the customer is premium; the process will link to an extra problem fix process,Relevant"
(this process will not be detailed here),Irrelevant
"In case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon; the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures – otherwise the process continues,Relevant"
Taking together the information,Relevant
(i.e. contract commitment data + prioritized actions),Irrelevant
a detailed problem report is created,Relevant
The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management,Relevant
Service Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers,Relevant
"After receiving the detailed problem report; Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning,Relevant"
"In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves; the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning,Relevant"
"If Service Management is sure they can analyze it; they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem,Relevant"
"After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report; it is checked whether there are any possible problems,Relevant"
"If no problems are detected; a notification about the normal service execution is created,Relevant"
If a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created,Relevant
Either trouble report or the ‘normal execution’ notification will be included in a status report and sent back to Service Management,Relevant
Service Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information,Relevant
Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report,Relevant
Three alternative process paths may be taken,Irrelevant
"For the case that no problem was detected at all; the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service,Relevant"
"For the case that minor corrective actions are required; Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves,Relevant"
"Subsequently; the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service,Relevant"
"After sending; this process path of Service Management ends,Relevant"
"For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required; Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration,Relevant"
This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning,Relevant
"Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request – but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out; otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process,Relevant"
"After the restoration request is received; all possible errors are tracked,Relevant"
"Based on the tracked errors; all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning,Relevant"
Then a trouble-shooting report is created,Relevant
"This report is sent out to Service Management; then the process ends,Relevant"
The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii),Relevant
Customer Service either receives the actual service performance (if there was no problem) or the problem resolution report,Relevant
"Then; two concurrent activities are triggered; i.e.,Relevant"
"i) a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem;,Relevant"
and ii) an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing,Relevant
The report for the customer is sent out to her,Relevant
After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service,Relevant
"After the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service; the process flow at the customer also ends,Relevant"
The process is initiated by a switch-over request,Relevant
"In doing so; the customer transmits his data to the customer service department of the company,Relevant"
Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution,Irrelevant
The customer data is received by customer service and based on this data a customer data object is entered into the CRM system,Relevant
After customer data has been entered it should then be compared with the internal customer data base and checked for completeness and plausibility,Relevant
In case of any errors these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list,Relevant
The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times,Irrelevant
"In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base; a new customer object is being created which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow,Relevant"
"This object consists of data elements such as the customer’s name and address and the assigned power gauge (including data such as bank connection; information on the selected rate; requested date of switch-over),Irrelevant"
"The generated customer object is then used; in combination with other customer data to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch,Relevant"
"(including data such as bank connection; information on the selected rate; requested date of switch-over),Irrelevant"
In the following an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS (customer information system) in order to confirm their successful generation,Relevant
"In case of a negative response;,Relevant"
i.e. the contract documents are not (or incorrectly) generated,Irrelevant
"; the causing issues are being analyzed and resolved,Relevant"
Subsequently the contract documents are generated once again,Relevant
In case of a positive response a confirmation document is sent out to the customer stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed,Relevant
A request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the CIS,Relevant
It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future,Relevant
"The switch-over request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence; and the grid operator transmits a response comment,Relevant"
"In the case of supplier concurrence; the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the resolution of the conflict,Relevant"
The grid operator communicates with the old supplier and carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier,Relevant
(i.e. the customer service (of the “new” supplier) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination),Irrelevant
If there are not any objections by the grid operator,Relevant
(i.e. no supplier concurrence),Irrelevant
customer service creates a CIS contract,Relevant
The customer then has the chance to check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it,Relevant
Depending on the customer’s acceptance/rejection the process flow at customer service either ends (in case of withdrawal) or continues (in case of a confirmation),Relevant
An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days – after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues,Relevant
The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary (as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way) but it can speed up the switch process,Irrelevant
"On the switch-date; but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun; the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption report,Relevant"
"At the same time; the grid operator computes the final billing based on the meter data and sends it to the old supplier,Relevant"
Likewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer,Relevant
For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then,Relevant
After receiving the meter data customer service imports the meter data to systems that require the information,Relevant
The process of “winning” a new customer ends here,Relevant
The first step is to determine contact details of potential customers,Relevant
This can be achieved in several ways,Irrelevant
"Sometimes; we buy details for cold calls; sometimes; our marketing staff participates in exhibitions and sometimes; you just happen to know somebody; who is interested in the product,Relevant"
Then we start calling the customer,Relevant
That is done by the call center staff,Relevant
They are determining the contact person and the budget which would be available for the project,Relevant
"Of course; asking the customer whether he is generally interested is also important,Relevant"
"If this is not the case; we leave him alone; except if the potential project budget is huge,Relevant"
Then the head of development personally tries to acquire the customer,Relevant
"If the customer is interested in the end; the next step is a detailed online presentation,Relevant"
It is given either by a sales representative or by a pre-sales employee in case of a more technical presentation,Irrelevant
Afterwards we are waiting for the customer to come back to us,Relevant
"If we are not contacted within 2 weeks; a sales representative is calling the customer,Relevant"
The last phase is the creation of a quotation,Relevant
"The credit company receives the credit information from the customer; If the requested amount is greater than 1M$ an approval must be requested,Relevant"
If the requested amount is lower or equal to 1M$ the company assess the risk of the credit,Relevant
"After the assessment; if the risk is high; an approval must be requested; but if the risk is low the credit is accepted,Relevant"

"f) Once all articles are captured; the total invoice amount is printed on the receipt and the billing process is completed.,Relevant"
"a) Upon receipt of an order from a customer or from sales; sales support uses the ""Sales & Distribution"" module (SD) to verify if customer master data is available.,Relevant"
"b) If this is a new customer; then the accounts receivables department (AR) is asked to create the customer master data.,Relevant"
The systems used for that purpose are AR and SD.,Irrelevant
c) Thereafter customer service captures the order in SD and performs a credit limit check on the order.,Relevant
If the customer´s credit limit is not exceeded then customer service posts the order and the process is completed.,Relevant
"d) If the credit limit is exceeded; then the order is put on hold.,Relevant"
The accounts receivables department inquires the reasons for the hold and asks customer service to cancel the order if the reasons are permanent.,Relevant
The process is completed in this case.,Relevant
"e) If the reasons for the credit hold are temporary; then the system checks regularly for incoming payments and releases the order if the credit is within the limit; customer service then posts the order.,Relevant"
"f) If the credit limit is still exceeded; then the order is kept on hold and the whole credit limit checking process starts all over again until the limit is met.,Relevant"
"a) When a customer calls; it is either to place a new order; or to ask for technical support; for information regarding an order; or none of the mentioned reasons.,Relevant"

"a) The manufacturing department creates a production order by converting a ""Planned Order"" (if available) using the ""Production Planning and Control"" (PP) system.,Relevant"
During the conversion process the basic data is created automatically.,Relevant
"b) Alternatively; the production order is created manually.,Relevant"
"In this case basic data (scheduling data; production order header data; quantity data) is entered manually.,Relevant"
c) Thereafter the system tries to determine the routing automatically.,Relevant
"If the routing is available; then operation data (operation data and PRT) is transferred from the routing to the production order.,Relevant"
"d) If the routing does not exist; then operation data is captured manually by the manufacturing department.,Relevant"
e) Thereafter the system automatically determines the BOM.,Relevant
"If the BOM exists; the components are transferred to the production order.,Relevant"
Otherwise then the components are entered manually.,Relevant
"f) Alternatively; the components may be transferred from the planned order; if the BOM has not been determined.,Relevant"

Finally the production order is saved.,Relevant
a) When a passenger (PAX) shows up at the express check-in counter the check-in agent determines whether the PAX carries hand luggage only or also additional luggage.,Relevant
b) If the PAX carries additional luggage the agent checks whether the PAX holds a business class ticket or an economy class ticket (ticket data) and sends the PAX to the corresponding check-in counter.,Relevant
c) For a PAX with hand luggage only the agent puts the ticket into the reader and checks whether the computer (reservation system) shows a choice of seats (window/aisle seats) or not.,Relevant
"d) If there is no choice the agent books an available seat immediately; otherwise he asks the PAX for his preference and books a seat accordingly.,Relevant"
e) Thereafter the check-in agent prints the boarding pass and returns the ticket/boarding pass to the PAX while telling gate and boarding time (airport & flight information system) to the PAX.,Relevant
f) After finishing either b) or e) the express check-in PAX handling is completed (the PAX has either been checked in or sent to another check in counter to check in his additional luggage).,Relevant
a) The first step in the handling of a business process is to distribute the assignments to the person in charge.,Relevant
This is carried out by the process manager in co-ordination with the department manager and supported by the workflow-system.,Relevant
"b) Once distributed; the person in charge processes the assignments using the workflow-system.,Relevant"
"c) If no issues occur; then the assignments are completed and the business process is completed.,Relevant"

a) A customer wants to start an auction.,Relevant
"Therefore; he must login in the auction system with his username and his password.,Relevant"
"If he enters this combination wrong three times; the system blocks the login for half an hour.,Relevant"
"b) If the login is correct; the system verifies whether the account is activated or not; using the account information.,Relevant"
"If the account has not yet been activated; the system forwards the user to the activating window and ends the start-process.,Relevant"
"c) If the account has been activated; the system verifies if the account is blocked.,Relevant"
"If a block exists; the customer will be informed; and the system ends the start-process.,Relevant"
"d) If the customer is not blocked; the system forwards him in his account.,Relevant"
There he can create an auction with the management software (MS).,Relevant
"At the beginning; the customer has to choose one category.,Relevant"
"e) After that; he has to enter the title of the auction and he can upload one or more images.,Relevant"
"There is a maximum size for the images; so the system will verify this automatically.,Relevant"
"If the picture is too big; the customer has to choose another one.,Relevant"
"f) Following this; the seller has to enter some product-specific information and an individual description.,Relevant"
"g) After entering both; the customer has to input: end time; payment details and transport information.,Relevant"
"h) When the seller has entered all these information; he can see a preview.,Relevant"
The seller can decide if he is satisfied or if he wants to change some entries.,Relevant
"Therefore the system goes back to the first step; where the customer has to choose a category.,Relevant"
"i) When the customer is satisfied; he posts the auction on the website; the process is over.,Relevant"
"a) There are two ways; the process may be started.,Relevant"
"On the one hand; a customer is interested in a specific product or group of products and approaches the customer consultant to speak to him.,Relevant"

a) The process starts with the arrival of a client with a car.,Relevant
"Once the client is already in the office; the front office clerk checks the existing appointments.,Relevant"
"b) If no appointment exists; the front office clerk tries to determine what sort of problem the customer has with his vehicle and once the possible problem has been determined and records about it have been made; the front office clerk checks the local IT system; using the created records to determine which division(s) is/are responsible for this kind of problem.,Relevant"
"After one or several divisions has/have been found in the system; the front office clerk checks for free capacities.,Relevant"
"On the other hand; if the customer already has an appointment; the the following process is described in d). ,Relevant"

"There is also a possible case when a customer agrees to make an appointment; but doesn't come back.,Relevant"
d) The office clerk stores the car.,Relevant
To perform this task he needs a car number and customer data to enter them in the local IT system.,Relevant
"After the car has been stored; the process continues with the actual repair (process navigation ""Repairs""; described in e)).,Relevant"
"Once the repair(s) has/have been done; the front office clerk gives the car to the customer (the local IT system is used).,Relevant"
"At the same time; the accounting department issues a bill using customer and car data; as well as information about the repair work provided (the system is Accounting & Management).,Relevant"
"Finally; when the both processes are completed; the customer leaves the service station.,Relevant"
"e) Once the car has been stored; the front office clerk uses the IT system to determine the next car to be sent for repair (schedule records; car number and division data are entered). Thereafter he has to check if the car is clean.,Relevant"

"i) After completion of the work in any of the three divisions; the quality control division performs a quality check.,Relevant"
"If problems still exist or another repair has to be done; the car is sent back to the front office to determine the division that will proceed with it.,Relevant"
"Alternatively; if the car is ready; the front office clerk stores the car.,Relevant"
a) The book production process starts when the acquiring editor submits a final book manuscript to the copy editor.,Relevant
The copy editor then reviews the final manuscript using his Book Editing Software.,Relevant
"As a result; all grammar errors; spelling errors or consistency errors are found.,Relevant"
"Afterwards; the copy editor corrects them and; at the same time; questions everything that is not clear in the text.,Relevant"
"b) Once the manuscript has been copyedited; an overall design direction is determined for the book by the creative team and the editor (book design software).,Relevant"
Then the creative team sends sample pages to the author.,Relevant
"After receipt of the sample pages; the creative team finalizes the design of the manuscript.,Relevant"
"c) At the same time; the copy editor submits the manuscript with queries to the editor and the author.,Relevant"
The author and the editor answer the queries and after that consult to finalize the text.,Relevant
"d) When the former processes are both finished ( b) and c)); the creative team creates a dummy book from the manuscript and the prepared design.,Relevant"
"Thereafter; all parties that participated in the process so far review the page layout; fit the copy; gauge the appropriateness of art to text and; if necessary; make other changes (the system used are design software and editing software).,Relevant"
"After completion of these tasks; the editor and the creative team check if the reviews made are sufficient.,Relevant"
"If not; the dummy book has to be reviewed once again by all parties.,Relevant"
"e) After a positive check; the text is sent back to the author.,Relevant"
"He either receives the text and art in a dummy book; or in page proofs and the process continues with f).,Relevant"
"In a parallel timeframe; the page proofs are reviewed by the editor; a proofreader and members of the production staff.,Relevant"
"If they find typos in the text; the typos are corrected by the editor.,Relevant"
"After all typos have been corrected and minor changes have been made; the editor checks if a fine-tuning is needed.,Relevant"
"If the need exists; the review of the page proofs starts again; if not - the process continues as described in f).,Relevant"
"f) For the files sent for printing and binding; the printing and binding process has to be executed.,Relevant"
"Thereafter the printing services synchronously send samples of the printed book to the sales department; send publicity mailings to media partners; distribute samples and rush advanced samples to the publisher.,Relevant"
"Once all these tasks are done; the printing services ship the books to the publisher's warehouse.,Relevant"
The publisher chooses to ship the books to individual bookstores or to distribution centers.,Relevant
"g) For the files sent for printing and binding; the printing and binding process has to be executed.,Relevant"
"Thereafter the printing services synchronously send samples of the printed book to the sales department; send publicity mailings to media partners; distribute samples and rush advanced samples to the publisher.,Relevant"
"Once all these tasks are done; the printing services ship the books to the publisher's warehouse.,Relevant"
The publisher chooses to ship the books to individual bookstores or to distribution centers.,Relevant
"h) For the files sent to the file converter; the e-book could be either prepared in-house; or; alternatively; from a freelancer.,Relevant"
"When the preparation of the e-book is done; the online retailers make the books available online; using data feeds systems.,Relevant"
"As of now; when books are already at the online retailers; they offer them to purchase and download on their websites (online bookstore system).,Relevant"
i) The manufacturing process ends after the last shipment of books from the publisher is ready and the books are available in the online stores.,Relevant
The books are now in the hands of booksellers and consumers.,Irrelevant
"The apex locator is an electronic device used in endodontics - a dental specialty - to determine the opening at the apex of the root of a tooth; through which the nerve and blood vessels pass.,Irrelevant"
The device presented has a multimedia display and operates with two buttons - a power button (ON/OFF) and VOLUME button to control the volume of the voice messages that guide the dentist during the measurement process.,Irrelevant
"In addition; a demo mode presentation can be started by holding the power button for a few seconds.,Irrelevant"
The device uses a Li-ion battery and the charging method is similar with this of a cell phone.,Irrelevant
"a) Upon pushing the ON/OFF button or plugging in the AC adapter; the software program starts the central processing unit and; at the same time; initializes the display driver.,Relevant"
"Once the display is active; the software program performs a check to find out if the AC adapter is plugged in.,Relevant"
"If this is the case - please follow e); if not - follow b).,Relevant"
"b) If no adapter is plugged in; the system checks if the ON/OFF button is still pushed.,Relevant"
"If the check is negative; please follow c). For a positive check - follow d).,Relevant"
"c) If the ON/OFF button is not pushed; the system loads an initial display.,Relevant"
"Once the initial display is started and the device is ready to measure; the software program checks if the VOLUME button has been pushed.,Relevant"
"If the check is negative; the following process is described in f); if the check is positive - follow g).,Relevant"
d) A positive check leads to the activation of the demo mode.,Relevant
Then the system displays a demo part.,Relevant
"Once it has been displayed; the system checks if this has been the last part.,Relevant"
"If it is not the last one; the process starts over and the system displays the next demo part.,Relevant"
A positive check means that all parts have been presented and leads to the new waiting activity described in k).,Relevant
"e) If the adapter is plugged in; the charging program is activated.,Relevant"
"Once the charging program is running; the system shows a ""Charging"" message on the display.,Relevant"
"After that; the software measures the elapsed time before continuing with further actions (time data is used).,Relevant"
"If the waiting time is less than 60 seconds; the system continues to wait.,Relevant"
"Alternative; if the waiting time exceeds 60 seconds; the system automatically switches the display off.,Relevant"
Then it regularly checks if any button has been pushed.,Relevant
"When this is the case; the ""Charging"" message has to be shown again.,Relevant"
"If no buttons have been pushed; the system proceeds with the waiting activity described in k).,Relevant"
"f) For the case that the VOLUME button has not been pushed; the device starts with the measurement process; deciding which measurement method is most appropriate.,Relevant"
"The choice is between method #1; method #2 or none of both.,Relevant"
"g) For the case that it has been pushed; the volume is increased by one level.,Relevant"
"Then either the volume already equals the maximum level; which demands the system to mute the device; or it is less than the maximum.,Relevant"
"Regardless of which case applies; the system always performs the VOLUME button check again.,Relevant"
"h) If method #1 has been chosen; the software program performs it.,Relevant"
"Once the method is performed and results are displayed; the system makes again the initial decision about which method is most suitable.,Relevant"
"i) If method #2 is suitable; the system determines whether subprogram #2.1 or #2.2 is appropriate and; after that; performs the chosen one.,Relevant"
"After a subprogram has been performed and results are displayed (additionally for #2.2; as a result; log files are saved); the software can choose again an appropriate method.,Relevant"
"j) The third option; when no appropriate method is found; leads also to the waiting activity described in k).,Relevant"
"k) The system now waits again and if 30 seconds have not been exceeded; the process starts all over again and the system checks again for an AC adapter.,Relevant"
"Finally; in the case that 30 or more seconds have already passed; the device automatically turns off.,Relevant"
"a) When developing a motherboard; the hardware design department selects a chipset that meets the requirements.,Relevant"
The module used by this department is called design software (Design SW is used at every step in this part).,Irrelevant
"After the chipset reference schematics and the chipset documents have been downloaded; the same department proceeds with searching for an appropriate motherboard.,Relevant"
"If the board is not close to the custom specification; the search process starts again.,Relevant"
"Otherwise; if a board closest to the custom specification has been found; it is then used as a starting schematic.,Relevant"
Then simultaneously the design department adds features from other reference boards and removes the useless features from the selected starting schematic.,Relevant
"b) In the next step; the hardware design department adds peripherals.,Relevant"
"Then the same department assures if there is an existing BIOS support for the peripherals and; at the same time; finds all reference boards of the peripherals that are not available on the chipset.,Relevant"
"For the case that no BIOS support is available; the process of adding of peripherals starts all over again.,Relevant"
"Once the reference boards are found; the materials management department (module MM) contacts the manufacturers of the peripherals that are not from the chipset.,Relevant"
"As a result; the manufacturer's information is provided.,Relevant"
"Once this is done and the BIOS support for all peripherals is available; the hardware design department continues to the next step - follow c).,Relevant"
c) The hardware design department now assures that the reference schematics for every peripheral used are available.,Relevant
"If any reference schematic is missing; the corresponding peripheral has to be replaced by a new one - the process starts over with the activity where peripherals are added.,Relevant"
"If all reference schematics are available; the hardware design department customizes them; which triggers the creation of a schematic symbol library.,Relevant"
Then the materials management department searches for components in every supplier database.,Relevant
"Once all components have been found; both the materials management and the hardware design department together gather all components information.,Relevant"
"Then; in parallel; the materials management department updates the description; the manufacturer information; the product numbers and the supplier's information.,Relevant"
"As a result; a preliminary schematic is available.,Relevant"
"d) Thereafter; the materials management department simultaneously generates a preliminary BOM and determines the component's prices; using the preliminary schematic and the component's information.,Relevant"
"After that; the same department compares the prices.,Relevant"
There are two possible scenarios.,Irrelevant
The chosen components are either offered at best prices or there are cheaper components on the market.,Relevant
If the first case applies - please follow f).,Relevant
"For the second case that there are cheaper components on the market; the hardware design department checks the component's quality.,Relevant"
"If the quality of the components is worse than this of the components chosen before; please follow f).,Relevant"
"e) For the case that the quality is the same or better; the materials management department contacts the new supplier and; as a result; conditions are negotiated.,Relevant"
"Alternatively; components may not be available via standard supplier and the materials management contacts directly the manufacturer; using the quotation data and the manufacturer's contact information.,Relevant"
"Consequently; a quotation is made.,Relevant"
"Regardless of which of the both cases applies; the process goes back to adding the new peripherals.,Relevant"
"f) In the next step; the sales department (using the Sales information system) calculates the price of the prototype and; at the same time; the price for board quantity of one thousand pieces.,Relevant"
"Thereafter the hardware design department is responsible for the following procedures: components' fitment checking; board size checking; carrying out of preliminary placement; creation of 3D model of the board; connector's fitment checking and components' height checking (some of the input data used are components; chipset; 3D data and connectors).,Relevant"
"g) After finishing of all procedures; two possible outcomes exist.,Relevant"
"In the first case; problems have occurred after the previous checks.,Relevant"
This forces the hardware design department to revise the problematic component(s).,Relevant
"If a peripheral needs to be replaced; the whole process starts over from adding a new one.,Relevant"
"If the revision has been successful or the second case applies (when the previous checks are done without any problems); the hardware department finishes the checkup.,Relevant"
"As a result; a checked schematic and a 3D model of the board are available and also the library is updated.,Relevant"
The materials management department can now order the components.,Relevant
"Once they are received; the hardware design department does the final placement.,Relevant"
"As the final outcomes; both the placement and the preliminary layout are done.,Relevant"
a) The process starts when a customer has entered the restaurant.,Relevant
The hostess then asks for an existing reservation.,Relevant
"If the customer says that he has a reservation; she checks the reservation entries using the reservation system.,Relevant"
"Then in the case that a reservation entry is found in the system; the hostess guides the customer to his table.,Relevant"
"b) In any other case; if the customer says that he does not have a reservation or a reservation entry cannot be found; the hostess searches for a free table.,Relevant"
"If a table is found; she guides the customer to it.,Relevant"
"If not; she asks him to wait.,Relevant"
"While he is still waiting; the hostess searches again for a free table.,Relevant"
"In the case that the customer is unwilling to wait; he leaves the restaurant and the process is over.,Relevant"
"c) Once the customer is at the table; the waitress brings the menu.,Relevant"
After that she asks for orders.,Relevant
The customer either wants to order or not.,Relevant
"d) For a customer that wants to order; the waitress takes the order using the ordering system.,Relevant"
"The customer may want something to drink; something to eat or both.*,Relevant"
"In the first case; the waitress passes the order to the bartender and once the drinks are ready; she serves them.,Relevant"
"In the second case; the same process applies to the meals (here; the order is passed to the kitchen).,Relevant"
"After the order is served; the waitress waits until the customer finishes his meal.,Relevant"
"Once this he has finished; she asks again for orders.,Relevant"
*The case when a customer orders several meals in one go is ignored.,Irrelevant
"e) For a customer that does not want to order; the waitress has to determine the reason.,Relevant"
"The customer either does not have more orders or; alternative; he is still not ready with his order.,Relevant"
"f) If the customer is still not ready; the waitress waits.,Relevant"
"Then after the customer has called the waitress or appropriate time is left; the waitress asks again for orders.,Relevant"
"g) If the customer does not want to order more; the waitress brings the bill.,Relevant"
"Here; the order and billing data are needed for the billing system.,Relevant"
"Once the bill is at the table; the waitress determines the payment method.,Relevant"
"Customers normally either want to pay cash; in which case the waitress settles the bill immediately; or want to pay with credit card.,Relevant"
"In the second case; she brings the mobile POS (mobile POS system).,Relevant"
"In the next step; the customer pays with his credit card and; as a result; the bill is settled.,Relevant"
"Finally; the customer leaves the restaurant and the process is over.,Relevant"
"Every weekday morning; the database is backed up and then it is checked to see whether the ""Account Defaulter"" table has new records.,Relevant"
"If no new records are found; then the process should check the CRM system to see whether new returns have been filed.,Relevant"
"If new returns exist; then register all defaulting accounts and customers.,Relevant"
"If the defaulting client codes have not been previously advised; produce another table of defaulting accounts and send to account management.,Relevant"
"All of this must be completed by 2:30 pm; if it is not; then an alert should be sent to the supervisor.,Relevant"
"Once the new defaulting account report has been completed; check the CRM system to see whether new returns have been filed.,Relevant"
"If new returns have been filed; reconcile with the existing account defaulters table.,Relevant"
This must be completed by 4:00 pm otherwise a supervisor should be sent a message.,Relevant
The Customer Service Representative sends a Mortgage offer to the customer and waits for a reply.,Relevant
"If the customer calls or writes back declining the mortgage; the case details are updated and the work is then archived prior to cancellation.,Relevant"
If the customer sends back the completed offer documents and attaches all prerequisite documents then the case is moved to administration for completion.,Relevant
If all pre-requisite documents are not provided a message is generated to the customer requesting outstanding documents.,Relevant
"If no answer is received after 2 weeks; the case details are updated prior to archive and cancellation.,Relevant"
"In November of each year; the Coordination Unit at the Town Planning Authority drafts a schedule of meetings for the next calendar year and adds draft dates to all calendars.,Relevant"
The Support Officer then checks the dates and suggests modifications.,Relevant
The Coordination Unit then rechecks all dates and looks for potential conflicts.,Relevant
"The final schedule of meeting dates is sent to all the independent Committee Members by email; who then check their diaries and advise the Coordination Unit of any conflicts.,Relevant"
"Once the dates are finalized (by the Coordination Unit); the Support Officer updates all group calendars and creates meeting folders for each meeting and ensures all appropriate documents are uploaded to system.,Relevant"
Committee Members are advised a week before each meeting to read all related documents.,Relevant
"The Committee Members hold their meeting; and the Support Office then produces minutes including any Action Points for each Committee Member.,Relevant"
"Within 5 working days; the Coordination Unit must conduct a QA check on the minutes; which are then sent to all Committee Members.,Relevant"
The Support Officer then updates all departmental records.,Relevant
"After the Expense Report is received; a new account must be created if the employee does not already have one.,Relevant"
The report is then reviewed for automatic approval.,Relevant
"Amounts under $200 are automatically approved; whereas amounts equal to or over $200 require approval of the supervisor.,Relevant"
"In case of rejection; the employee must receive a rejection notice by email.,Relevant"
The reimbursement goes to the employee's direct deposit bank account.,Relevant
"If the request is not completed in 7 days; then the employee must receive an ""approval in progress"" email,Relevant"
"If the request is not finished within 30 days; then the process is stopped and the employee receives an email cancellation notice and must re-submit the expense report.,Relevant"
"After the Process starts; a Task is performed to locate and distribute any relevant existing designs; both electrical and physical.,Relevant"
"Next; the design of the electrical and physical systems starts in parallel.,Relevant"
Any existing or previous Electrical and Physical Designs are inputs to both Activities.,Relevant
Development of either design is interrupted by a successful update of the other design.,Relevant
"If interrupted; then all current work is stopped and that design must restart.,Relevant"
"In each department (Electrical Design and Physical Design); any existing designs are reviewed; resulting in an Update Plan for their respective designs (i.e. one in Electrical and another in Physical).,Relevant"
"Using the Update Plan and the existing Draft of the Electrical/Physical Design; a revised design is created.,Relevant"
Once completed the revised design is tested.,Relevant
"If the design fails the test; then it is sent back to the first Activity (in the department) to review and create a new Update Plan.,Relevant"
"If the design passes the test; then it tells the other department that they need to restart their work.,Relevant"
"When both of the designs have been revised; they are combined and tested.,Relevant"
"If the combined design fails the test; then they are both sent back to the beginning to initiate another design cycle; if the designs pass the test; then they are deemed complete and are then sent to the manufacturing Process [a separate Process].,Relevant"
The goods are divided into two types: cold and warm.,Irrelevant
"All cold goods are simply taken from the storehouse; whereas warm goods are prepared half an hour before the delivery starts.,Relevant"
"After the customer has chosen several gold and warm goods; he can proceed to the checkout.,Relevant"
"The checkout requires the selection of 1) a customer profile; 2) the delivery time; and 3) the credit card number; which is debited at the bank.,Irrelevant"
Afterwards the order is saved and the customer receives confirmation e-mail.,Relevant
The customer should be able to cancel orders at any time until one hour before the delivery time.,Relevant
The catering service has to check open orders frequently to prepare warm goods in time for delivery.,Relevant
"After all cold and warm goods have been collected or prepared; they are delivered to the customer.,Relevant"
The next day after the delivery an e-mail is send to the customer asking for feedback about the quality of the service and goods.,Relevant
A travel agency wants to establish a booking service.,Irrelevant
"The service is triggered by an incoming request and can return two different messages; either an unavailable notification or a confirmation.,Irrelevant"
The business process of the service starts by first checking the request.,Relevant
"If for certain reasons the request can only be handled manually by an employee (e.g. group travels); a sub-process for manual handling is activated.,Relevant"
"Otherwise; the process enters a transactional sub-process; where a bus and hotel booking occur in parallel.,Relevant"
"However; if one of these fails; the transaction is canceled; a log message is written and the unavailability message is sent.,Relevant"
"If both bookings succeed; an attraction is booked by invoking another service.,Relevant"
"The only thing that could go wrong is a timeout; i.e. the attraction booking service is not responding in time.,Relevant"
"If this happens; a manual handling of the booking has to be made.,Relevant"
"If the attraction booking invocation succeeds; a confirmation is sent.,Relevant"
The manual handling always results in a successful booking in which case a confirmation message is sent.,Relevant
End-of-study projects in an industrial environment is a mandatory part in the Bachelor curriculum.,Irrelevant
"The students are not yet involved in the planning phase; where each research group interacts with its industry partners.,Irrelevant"
"As the project proposals have to be handed in to the faculty by 30 June; the research group starts planning in the beginning of June.,Irrelevant"
The group sends request to all of its partners and waits for their proposals for at most a week.,Relevant
The group selects the two most interesting proposals and starts planning the details for these two proposals.,Relevant
"First; the proposal is worked over in several iterations:,Relevant"
"The group updates the proposal document; before it is sent to the partner who in turn updates it and sends it back.,Relevant"
"Once the document has reached a final status; it is handed in to the faculty.,Relevant"
The faculty decides which of the proposals will be accepted.,Relevant
The outcome of this decision results in one of two messages: Either the project proposal was rejected or it was accepted.,Relevant
In the latter case the group announces this positive result to the corresponding partner.,Relevant
"After the reception of a meeting remainder; a new account must be created if the employee does not already have one.,Relevant"
The report is then reviewed for automatic approval.,Relevant
"Amounts under $200 are automatically approved; whereas amounts equal to or over $200 require approval of the supervisor.,Relevant"
"In case of rejection; the employee must receive a rejection notice by email.,Relevant"
The reimbursement goes to the employee’s direct deposit bank account.,Relevant
"If the request is not completed in 7 days; then the employee must receive an “approval in progress” email If the request is not finished within 30 days; then the process is stopped.,Relevant"
