 If so and they buy the process in point 3 begins,Relevant

 The customer can then buy directly or think about it,Relevant
 If he buys   the payment is as follows: the customer pays a deposit of 30% with the order of the kitchen and the balance is paid before the delivery of the kitchen,Relevant
 If he decides to think about it   the customer is called again a few days later to find out his decision and whether any changes are needed,Relevant
 When the customer decides to order the kitchen   he signs the order form and a fitter is sent to the customer's home to check the measurements,Relevant
 If the measurements are not good   the kitchen is modified according to the measurements given by the fitter,Relevant
 If the kitchen needs a lot of work   the kitchen is redesigned and the customer is called because there is a risk of a price difference,Relevant
 It is a lot of work if the customer made wrong measurements,Irrelevant
 When everything is done   we give the technical plan to the customer and we send the order of the kitchen to the factory with the right measurements,Relevant
