Before every publication  digital or paper  the articles are corrected by a spelling software a first time and a second time by a professional reviewer whose job is to avoid mistakes in the spelling and to ensure an optimal layout for the article,Relevant
Once the page for the daily newspaper is finished  it is sent to the rotary press in Nivelles,Relevant
This concludes the article writing and publishing process,Relevant
As soon as the pages from the different upcoming newspapers are received  the printing process begins at the Nivelles printing,Relevant
First  relief plates are made for every single page of each newspaper,Relevant
Then  these plates are put four by four on the rotary press,Relevant
Once this step is operated  the rotary press is switched on,Relevant
Then  plates go in the four primary colors and the newspapers  pages are printed,Relevant
At this stage  a mechanical system allows to assemble pages with one another  fold and bind them to form the newspaper,Relevant
The newspapers are then automatically packaged and are ready to be shipped,Relevant
During the whole work of the machine  printing  assembling     the work of the employee is simply reduced to monitor the machine,Irrelevant
The supply process of daily newspapers is critical and is obviously relying on the nature of past processes,Irrelevant
Any delay can be toxic for the supply process and could cause terrible financial losses for Sudpresse and for booksellers themselves,Irrelevant
First  we will focus on individual newspaper delivery,Irrelevant
Newspapers must be ready for delivery at 01 00 a m    they are put into trucks and taken to the sorting office in Brussels,Relevant
They are then charged 30 minutes before the departure into night trains taking them to the cities where the different sorting centers are located,Relevant
Once the newspapers are in those centers  vans are used to deliver them to the local post offices,Relevant
The postmen then deliver the newspapers in individual mailboxes,Relevant
This must take place before 7 30am  as it is essential that a good part of workers have enough time to read their newspaper before going to work,Relevant
We will now focus on bookshops delivery,Irrelevant
Instead of going to the Sorting post office in Brussels  trucks go straight to regional private delivery centers,Relevant
Newspapers are then sorted and dispatched in vans that deliver over four thousand bookshops all over Belgium,Relevant
This type of delivery should take place even earlier than the individual deliveries  7am at the latest  as bookshops make half of their daily sales before 9 am,Irrelevant
Through this process description  we realize that timing is essential in the press sector,Irrelevant
Nowadays  writing and creating new articles does not suffice to create enough value for multimedia companies,Irrelevant
Therefore  various advertising processes are in constant change in the press industry and are therefore impossible to describe entirely,Irrelevant
Nevertheless  thanks to the two interviews we have conducted with our contacts at Sudpresse  we were able to identify some crucial steps in these processes,Irrelevant
We established earlier that there is a market department running many analyses in order to determine what are the best advertising spots on the website  which format  which size  which colors  which position on the page  etc,Relevant
The IT department will then determine who sees what advert and most importantly  these people s background and profile by using big data,Relevant
Once the advertising spots have been defined  it is time for the sales department to intervene,Relevant
Using the data previously collected  sales teams have to sell these spots to advertisers,Relevant
Advertisers have many options,Irrelevant
On the newspaper  they can choose to advertise on a quarter of a page  half a page or an entire page  knowing that each of these options has a different cost and impact on the reader,Relevant
Different spots can be chosen on the website,Irrelevant
One option of advertising on the website is through storytelling  which has been a growing tendency in the previous years,Relevant
In this case  advertising is made through an interview of a representative of the concerned company  ending with a link to the company s website,Relevant
The interview is in this case realized after the writing of the contract,Relevant
An advertisement may appear one or multiple times  depending on the agreement that has been made between the sales teams and the advertiser,Relevant
Once the advertiser has decided what he wishes to do  a contract is written by the sales department of Sudpresse,Relevant
When it is done  the contract is sent to the advertiser,Relevant
The contract is often approved by the advertisers,Relevant
If it is not  the contract is reviewed,Relevant
A contract is never abandoned because if a contract has been written  it is because there is a demand from an advertiser,Irrelevant
The advert is then created and published in the chosen canals with a determined frequency and time frame,Relevant
The catering process starts when a customer calls a Poivre Sel point of sale for its services,Relevant
One of the employees answers the phone call and asks automatically for the date and the number and variety of products wanted,Relevant
The employee then asks for the customer s usual point of sale,Relevant
If the client doesn t call his her usual point of sale  the employee has to conduct the customer to the usual one and the order is sent there,Relevant
If the client is a new or a usual one  10 the employee then asks for the address,Relevant
Afterwards  he checks the availability of the employees on this date and this address,Relevant
If none of the employees is available  the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise  the employee answering the call determines the type category of the client and as a result of this proposes a series of products specific to the client,Relevant
It is then the job of the franchisor  CEO  to emit the invoice to the client,Relevant
He receives the payment and checks if there is any missing information,Relevant
If information is missing  he sends a formal notice to the customer with the ERP system of Poivre Sel  Teamleader ,Relevant
The franchisor receives the missing information and if it is still missing the purchase order is rejected,Relevant
When the payment is completed  the employees can start the order,Relevant
They deliver the order at the social event and the purchase order is completed,Relevant
The franchising process is quite simple,Irrelevant
Anyone interested in becoming a franchisee can obtain information at a point of sale or and on the website,Relevant
He then contacts Mr  Buche to ask him if he can become a franchisee,Relevant
Then Mr  Buche will meet with the interested party to explain the principle of his company and its history,Relevant
After this discussion  he asks the franchisee if he is still interested,Relevant
The franchisee will then give an answer to the franchisor,Relevant
If he decides to continue  then Mr  Buche will take him on a day long immersion trip to his point of sale in order to learn more about the franchisee and to show him how a day in a point of sale goes,Relevant
After that day  both parties take a week to think about whether or not they want to continue,Relevant
The decision comes from both parties,Relevant
If they continue  the prospective franchisee must sign a confidentiality document,Relevant
Once this is done  the franchisee starts looking for a location for their new outlet,Relevant
Once he has found it  he will show it to Mr  Buche so that he can take care of the market research and a cost benefit calculation to see if the location is ideal and profitable,Relevant
If it is not  the franchisee has to look for another location,Relevant
If it is  the calculations are sent to the franchisee s accountant for validation,Relevant
Once validated  it takes a few months for the fieldworks to be completed and then the franchisee pays Mr  Buche for the fieldworks,Relevant
The franchisee can then finally open his point of sale,Relevant
The franchisee receives the calendar of meetings for the year,Irrelevant
One of the franchisees has a new recipe idea,Relevant
He waits for the next meeting to propose it,Relevant
Then  we see if the idea is appreciated  if not  we stop,Relevant
If it is appreciated  the franchisee  who had the idea  suggests to make a vote,Relevant
The vote is made with all the franchisees and the franchisor by raising their hand,Relevant
If the majority raises their hands  we make the recipe  if not the requested is rejected,Relevant
A customer arrives in front of the cashier at Poivre Sel to eat,Relevant
First of all  the cashier asks him whether he is eating on the spot or to take away,Relevant
If the customer eats on the spot  the waiter makes him sit down and asks the customer what he wants to eat,Relevant
Once the order is taken  the waiter gives the order to the cook who prepares it and gives it back to the waiter once it is ready,Relevant
The waiter then takes the dish back and serves it to the customer,Relevant
Then the waiter waits until the customer s meal is over  i e  when the customer calls the waiter,Relevant
The waiter will then send him the invoice and receive payment from the customer and then hand over the money received at the cash desk,Relevant
If the customer has taken out  the cashier asks the customer for the order,Relevant
Then gives the order to the cook who prepares it and returns it to the cashier once the preparation is finished,Relevant
Then the cashier issues the invoice to the customer who pays it and the cashier gives him his meal,Relevant
If a product is missing from Poivre Sel he rings their supplier to see if the product is available  the office  manager  checks the database to see if the product is still in stock,Relevant
If the product is available  we ask for the quantity of this product  x  at Poivre Sel which will determine the quantity and then notify the supplier who will be able to prepare an invoice and send it  once the invoice is received and paid the stock manager will supply the product at Poivre Sel,Relevant
If the product is no longer available  the supplier asks for salt and pepper  if he wants to order  if the answer is no it is the end of the process if it is yes the supplier sends all the information  invoice delivery date  by e mail,Relevant
The process starts with the arrival of the worker at Emerson,Relevant
A renewal contract is when the end of his last contract is greater than 12 months,Irrelevant
He goes to the line manager who welcomes him  then he signs the contract and receives the badge,Relevant
Later  the line manager accompanies him to the social store,Relevant
He begins his training and medical supervision  and the process is over for him,Relevant
If the duration of his contract is less than 12 months  it is considered as a first contract,Relevant
Therefore  the worker is registered at the guard post  then he is greeted by the head of the department  who signs the contract and accompanies him to the social store and shows the worker the factory,Relevant
Later  the HR Business Partner transmits the Welcome Pack to the worker  then the training coordinator receives singled documents and classifies documents in personal files,Relevant
If an IT account must be created  the training coordinators must first present and then send the signature of the IT policy,Relevant
If not  the worker can receive induction training and medical supervision directly,Relevant
The process starts with the expiration of the contract,Relevant
Then  an exit interview takes place with the temporary worker and the coordinator  his release date is encoded on HR Access  the human resources management software package,Relevant
The C4  the unemployment certificate  and the certificate of employment is sent and issued to the worker by the coordinator then who then archives the paper file,Relevant
After that  the worker returns first clothes and keys at the social store and then the badge after the last score,Relevant
Finally the HR Payroll Specialist triggers the bonus at the end of year in HR access  applies the legislation on payment of the days after discharge  clears RHT and RTT hours and the process is ended,Relevant
The process starts with the payment of a deposit,Relevant
Then the HP Payroll Specialist emails to horses  managers before 10 a m  to conclude it,Relevant
Later  he carries out a different point of the checklist and encodes down payment work on the HR Access software,Relevant
He then downloads the payment batch on the bank s website and requests the lot signature to the Finance Manager who signs it,Relevant
Finally  the HP Payroll Specialist checks the sent lot and the worker receives the salary,Relevant
The process begins with the requirement of the Emerson Company,Relevant
The plant HR director invites the hierarchical manager to establish the schedule of objective meetings who will then carry out the evaluation with his employee via the HR Access pre software and will then transmit to the plant HR director,Relevant
if the manager has received the evaluations  he must review them  otherwise the plant HR director will invite the hierarchical manager again to review the evaluations and continue the process,Relevant
If the assessment is understandable  the plant HR director if we need training  if so  we set up training  and we evolve the performance of the end of the year and the performance assessment is completed,Relevant
If the evaluation sent is incomprehensible  the plant HR director discusses with the hierarchical manager who will complete and inform the collaborator who will send the document back to the plant HR director for review evaluation and the process continues normally,Relevant
The process starts when a position becomes available,Relevant
The HR Business Partner drafts the internal announcement and the HR Director validates the content of the announcement via the HR Access pre software  then sends it to the HR Business Partner for the dissemination of the internal announcement,Relevant
The HR Business Partner determines the evaluation criteria and then receives the applications by email,Relevant
The HR Business Partner conducts interviews and tests and evaluates them afterwards,Relevant
If the candidates respond to the applications of the function  they are informed by email and their personal data is deleted with the HR access pre software and finally they are ready to be hired,Relevant
If the candidates do not respond to the applications of the function  they consult the reserve of spontaneous applications,Relevant
The first business process is inbound logistics,Irrelevant
An employee takes care of placing the order with the suppliers,Relevant
All the raw materials needed to manufacture the finished products are stored in a large refrigerated hall within the company,Relevant
There is also a storage room that serves as a freezer because some materials arrive frozen,Irrelevant
The process of outbound logistics is quite similar to that of inbound logistics,Irrelevant
First of all  the company receives requests for the delivery of goods from outside  supermarkets  small shops    ,Relevant
Then  Goumanisto checks its stocks to see if it has the quantities requested by the buyers,Relevant
If it does not have them  it will send a note to inform the purchasing company of the impossibility of supplying the quantities requested,Relevant
The purchasing company can also decide to maintain the order  in which case Goumanisto will produce the missing products,Relevant
Once the products are available  the company will make up pallets that will be sent to the various stores via a delivery company,Relevant
As far as the recruitment process is concerned  it starts when a person shows interest in working for the company,Relevant
For operators  Goumanisto either uses a temporary employment agency to provide the necessary manpower or receives unsolicited applications  most of which are based on the knowledge of existing workers,Relevant
Each recruitment procedure consists of a minimum of 2  sometimes 3  interviews with the applicant,Relevant
The first one is with the direct manager  i e  the operations manager if the company is looking to hire an operator,Relevant
The second interview takes place in the presence of the company s managers,Relevant
Following this second interview  they decide whether or not the person is suitable,Relevant
Production is a very important business process at Goumanisto,Irrelevant
About 50 people are employed in production  and almost half of them come from the sheltered workshop,Irrelevant
The first room is made up of a recently acquired machine  it allows the various products to be cut very quickly and precisely,Relevant
Four to five workers are needed for this machine to work properly,Relevant
Then there is another machine that weighs the cut products and divides them into different batches according to the quantities required,Relevant
The next step is the reception of the products and their packaging,Relevant
This step is done by production line,Relevant
Currently there is a manual line with 10 people and an automated line with 5 people,Relevant
The automatic line checks that the machines properly close the boxes with plastic paper  then the manual line closes the boxes with plastic lids,Relevant
Goumanisto s objective is to acquire a new automated line by February 2021,Irrelevant
Finally  the various plastic boxes have to be closed and packed in cardboard boxes  both operations are still done manually,Relevant
This one could be a good candidate for automation,Irrelevant
Indeed  the labelling and the placing of the products packed in the cardboard boxes are still done manually so it would represent a saving of time if the company were to automate this process,Irrelevant
R D is also an important process for the organization,Irrelevant
Members are looking for new product ideas that may appeal to consumers,Irrelevant
Most often the company uses market research done by the wholesale distribution to whom it sells its products instead of doing its own surveys,Relevant
Then  they analyze the results of market research in order to embark on the development of new ideas of products,Relevant
The point of product ideas is obviously that these products can be sold in large quantities and at a lower price,Irrelevant
Then they compute the potential costs of producing these new product ideas,Relevant
If these can be profitable and lead to profit subsequently  they are validated by the R D department and presented to the general council,Relevant
On the other hand  if they could not be profitable  everything falls apart and the process stops,Relevant
It will therefore be necessary to start all over from the development of new product ideas,Relevant
The process starts when a client wants to employ temporary workers,Relevant
The client sends an email with a job description to the agency,Relevant
An Asap consultant analyzes the job description,Relevant
Then  he checks if there is an existing profile in the agency s database,Relevant
If a matching profile has been found  the process to employ a candidate begins,Relevant
If the candidate has been employed  the process ends,Relevant
If he has not been employed  the consultant will recheck in the database in order to search for another potential profile,Relevant
If one is found  the loop is going again,Relevant
If not an announcement is published on the agency site,Relevant
Moreover the consultant has to check the specificity of the job,Relevant
Indeed  when the client wants a very specific candidate  the agency has to actively research a candidate in addition to the published announcement,Relevant
When the job does not require any specific skills  the consultant only needs to wait for candidates to propose themselves,Relevant
Whether it would be a specific or a non specific job  when a candidate respondsto the announcement  the to employ a candidate process can start,Relevant
If the candidate has been employed  the process ends,Relevant
If the candidate has not been employed  the consultant researches or waits again for a candidate to answer the announcement,Relevant
However  if the agency can not find a candidate fast enough  the client must send a message to the agency to ask them to stop the process,Relevant
Indeed  the client works with several agencies so if another agency finds a candidate before Asap  the client has to warn Asap,Relevant
So  when Asap receives a message from the client  the agency must stop his searching process,Relevant
The process starts when a profile of interim which matches with the announcement has been found,Relevant
The first step is to call the candidate for a phone screening,Relevant
After the phone call  the candidate and the consultant agree for a date for a meeting,Relevant
Another option is that the consultant realized during the phonescreening that the candidate was not suitable for the job,Relevant
If so  the process ends,Relevant
If a meeting has been agreed  the consultant sends an email to the candidate with a confirmed date and some information over the meeting,Relevant
On the convenued day  the candidate goes to the meeting and the consultant rules the meeting,Relevant
The meeting starts when the candidate arrives,Relevant
So  the consultant can start the meeting,Irrelevant
Before discussing specific topics of the job  he has to check the candidate references,Relevant
After the discussion  the candidate has to pass a cognitive test,Relevant
The meeting ends when he leaves,Relevant
After the meeting  the consultant sends a report over the meeting to the client,Relevant
Then they have to wait for the client to respond,Relevant
When the client sends a feedback of the report to the agency  there are two possibilities,Relevant
On one hand  if the feedback is bad  the client does not want the candidate so the agency must send him a rejection message,Relevant
In this case  the process ends,Relevant
On the other hand  if the feedback is good  the client wants the candidate so the agency must send him an approval message,Relevant
After sending the message  the consultant makes the contract that he sends for the candidate to confirm and sign the contract,Relevant
The candidate resends the signed contract to the agency which then sends the contract to the client,Relevant
In this case  the candidate is employed and the process ends,Relevant
When the social secretary of ASAP receives the hours worked by the candidate for the client  the process can start,Relevant
The first step is to inform the bank to pay the hours worked,Relevant
When the bank receives the message from ASAP  she has to pay the worked hours to the candidate s bank account,Relevant
The candidate is then informed that he has received the payment,Relevant
The candidate checks if the payment is correct,Relevant
If it is the case  the process is fulfilled,Relevant
If it is not  he must inform the agency about the payment error,Relevant
On the side of the agency  if she doesn t receive a message from the candidate  the process is fulfilled but  when a payment error message is received  the agency must check if the candidate has been paid too much or not enough paid,Relevant
When the candidate has not been paid enough  the bank has to pay the extra hours on the candidate bank account and the process is fulfilled,Relevant
If the candidate has been too much paid  the agency must request a refund from the candidate,Relevant
So  the candidate pays the hours not worked to the bank and the process ends,Relevant
 We can imagine that the candidates would not send an error message if he has been paid too much,Irrelevant
However some of them do and ASAP counts on their honesty ,Irrelevant
The process starts when an employee evaluation is needed,Relevant
The superior calls the employee,Relevant
They plan a meeting together,Relevant
After the phone call  the superior sends an email with the confirmed date of the meeting,Relevant
On the said date  the employee goes to the meeting,Relevant
So  the superior can start the meeting,Relevant
He first checks if the KPIs of the employee are good,Relevant
Then  he discusses with him about his general feeling in the company,Relevant
After that  the superior can end the meeting,Relevant
When the meeting is finished and the employee is left  the superior makes a feedback that he sends to his employee,Relevant
From there  there are three possibilities,Relevant
Either the feedback is good so nothing happens or it is the first bad feedback so the superior warns his employee or it is the second bad feedback so the superior sends a breach of contract to his employee,Relevant
After each possibility  the process ends,Relevant
 We can surely say that the breach of the contract can be negotiated depending on the circumstances ,Irrelevant
When the agency has given a service to one of his clients  a consultant makes an invoice,Relevant
The business manager then checks the invoice,Relevant
 The invoice may not be correct if the client has had a credit note on a past delivery ,Irrelevant
If the invoice is not correct  the business manager resends the invoice to the consultant and he has to make the invoice again,Relevant
If the invoice is correct  the consultant can send the invoice to the client,Relevant
When the invoice has been sent  the consultant waits for the payment,Relevant
If the payment arrives within 5 days  the process is fulfilled,Relevant
If it is not the case  the consultant calls the client with a first warning,Relevant
After this call  if the payment has been completed within 5 days  the process ends,Relevant
If not  the account manager calls the client for a second warning,Relevant
The client has to pay within 5 days to finish the process if not the account manager sends an email about a potential bailiff venue and informs the bailiff about his potential venue,Relevant
To finish the process  there are two possibilities,Relevant
Either the client pays his debt within 50 days and the process ends or the account manager contacts the bailiff and the process is finished,Relevant
 the delays are so short because ASAP has to pay the temporary workers one week after the last day of the mission As mentioned above ,Irrelevant
The process starts with the interest of the client in finding a solution to the digital transformation his company needs  the first task is to propose and describe the 3 Bizz Online packs  get a response from the client  charge him and inform DJM,Relevant
The first contact always starts within Proximus stores  but the salesman only acts as an intermediate and only during the selling phase  after fulfilling the order he steps out of the conversation and an employee of DJM takes this over  firstly the manager,Relevant
The process starts when a customer enters a Proximus shop  either the customer goes to a Proximus shop because he is a freelancer interested in the Bizz online packs  or the seller proposes the Bizz online packs to him,Relevant
If the customer refuses the offer  the process is over,Relevant
On the other hand  if the customer is interested in the pack  the seller offers him the choice between 3 packs  S M L,Relevant
These packs are categorized according to their size  options and functionality,Irrelevant
They go from the most basic to the most specific,Irrelevant
Once the customer has made his choice  the seller informs a DJM manager of the customer s new request via an ERP system set up between the 2 companies  DJM and Proximus,Relevant
Bizz online employees then start a discussion with the customer in order to prepare the website as well as possible,Relevant
When the website is prepared  it is sent to the customer  who can then request the latest changes if he wants before the website is published,Relevant
If the client is satisfied with the website  it is published on the internet and the process is completed,Relevant
If the customer does not respond to the message sent within 5 days  a reminder message is sent,Relevant
This process starts when the client  who has already chosen either the M  pack or the L pack  is interested in receiving an e shop as an option in his pack,Relevant
After invoicing in a Proximus shop  the request of the client goes to a project manager of Bizz online who gets in touch with the client so that they can discuss the project,Relevant
Then  it s the webmaster who produces the e shop taking into account the suggestions of the client and does the modifications if necessary,Relevant
This process ends when the e shop is published,Relevant
The process starts when the manager receives a complaint,Relevant
He then registers it and transfers it to the webmaster,Relevant
The webmaster analyses the complaint and if more information is needed  he recontacts the client to receive the missing pieces of information,Relevant
If he can resolve it directly  he skips those steps and resolves it,Relevant
Then the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when a jobseeker sends his or her application to DJM by e mail,Relevant
The project manager receives the application and checks whether it contains the CV and covering letter  whether it contains the basic data such as name and surname  and whether the applicant has the required diploma to work at DJM,Relevant
If the documents are incomplete  the project manager will inform the applicant,Relevant
If the documents are complete  the project manager will contact the applicant through one of the channels provided on the CV to find a time to place an interview,Relevant
After the interview  if the candidate is hired  the project manager will send a rejection email,Relevant
After the interview  if the candidate is hired  an email is also sent to inform him her of the news,Relevant
The project manager then begins to enter the information collected from the application,Relevant
If he she notices that he she is missing data  he she contacts the candidate again to complete the application with the missing data,Relevant
Then he creates the contract  which he then sends,Relevant
The process starts when an employee is needed,Relevant
Then  the first task is made by the Head of department  who has to give specific criteria of the job  requirements  skills needed  ,Relevant
Once the task is completed  the HR employee has to see if it is a specific more special demand  or not,Relevant
Usually for nurses  they will look at spontaneous applications on the hospital website,Relevant
For more specific functions  they will externalize the process and recruit via Forum,Relevant
For more special requests  for example  energy engineer   they make an offer on the website themselves,Relevant
After having collected the CV  the HR employee has to to make a selection based on the head of department s criteria,Relevant
If there are a lot of applications  he can decide to filter the candidates by doing a written exam in order to screen people,Relevant
Due to the written exam  he has to select candidate and review application,Relevant
Once the task is completed  he has to decide if he approve or not the candidate,Relevant
If he didn t approve it  a rejection email will be sent to the applicant and the process is finished,Relevant
In the other case  the HR employee will have to schedule an online interview,Relevant
The head of the department has to conduct the personal interview and based on that  he will decide if he hire or not the candidate,Relevant
If he doesn t want to hire him or her a rejection email is sent to the candidate and the process is finished,Relevant
In the other case  the head of department has to inform the HR employee that the applicant is hired,Relevant
Finally  the HR employee has to create an administrative file with the applicant s information and create the employment contract,Relevant
Once the tasks are completed the process is finished    applicant employed ,Relevant
The process takes place in emergencies,Irrelevant
It starts when a patient arrives at the emergency room,Relevant
The emergency service has to register the patient and take his or her vital parameters as blood  pressure and so on,Relevant
These data are entered in the DPI system by the emergency service  which allows the doctor  even if he is not on site to consult that information,Relevant
The doctor specialist has to check the patient s data,Relevant
based on that  he has to evaluate the urgency,Relevant
If he considers that it is not urgent  he has to give instructions to the emergency doctor,Relevant
Then the emergency doctor has to treat the patient  schedule an appointment and discharge him or her,Relevant
Once the tasks are completed  the process is finished,Relevant
In the other case  which means that the doctor specialist considers that it is an urgency  he has to inform the nurses and check bed availability at the same time,Relevant
Nurses will then register the person in their department,Relevant
They absolutely have to have the approval of the medical specialist before they admit someone,Relevant
They cannot register a patient without that,Irrelevant
Finally  the nurses have to move the patient from the emergency room to the room service,Relevant
The process starts when medications are needed,Relevant
The first task is made by the nurse who has to check their department s drug needs for each patient,Relevant
The nurse then group everything together and send the order by fax  usually to the pharmacy,Relevant
In all hospitals  there is a pharmacy  so orders are sent there and directly processed,Relevant
The pharmacy checks if they have everything  usually they have everything ,Relevant
If some medications are missing  they have to inform the nurse of the product s non availability,Relevant
Then  they have to check the availability of the medications in another service  and send someone to take them,Relevant
Once they have received the medications  they have to notify the nurse  prepare all the medications and finally deliver them to the nurse,Relevant
The last task is made by the nurse  who has to prepare the medications for each patient,Relevant
Once the task is done  the process is finished    medications prepared ,Relevant
There are several possible cases ,Irrelevant
  In case of end of contract At the end of the contract  replacement contract  fixed term contract  there is nothing is simply over for the employee,Relevant
  In case of dismissal Dismissal can be caused by many things  usual causes ,Relevant
If the dis missal is sufficiently justified  HR will take care of giving notice,Relevant
  In the event of a decision to discontinue  e,Relevant
redirection to another hospital  It is up to the employee to request advance notice,Relevant
HR will ensure that the notice period is acceptable,Relevant
This process especially concerns the Meuse Tube Clinic in Flémalle  this clinic belongs to the CHBA group,Irrelevant
However  the process cannot be the same as in Seraing,Irrelevant
When a patient wishes to make an appointment  he can do so through three different channels  this can be done by phone  by mail  or on the spot at the counter,Relevant
In all three cases  the patient will come across the reception desk of the clinic,Relevant
However  if it is done by e mail  it may take longer to get an answer,Irrelevant
The receptionist will look at the places available and suggest an appointment date to the patient  then  an appointment will be scheduled,Relevant
The person at the reception desk will then check his or her contact details via his or her identity card and health insurance,Relevant
The patient has to pay directly on the spot  he will eventually receive an invoice,Relevant
After waiting in the waiting room  the doctor sees the patient,Relevant
He will check the  patient s medical history  in the CPR  computerized patient record   examine the patient and give recommendations for treatment,Relevant
Eventually  the doctor may request additional tests if the situation requires it or even transfer the patient to the emergency room in case of an emergency,Relevant
He can also schedule a hospitalization if he wants to follow the patient in real time,Relevant
The invoicing service will take care of the invoice which will depend on the technical services performed during the consultation  the status of the person and his or her health insurance company,Relevant
The maintenance and repair process uses one main software   Carpark,Irrelevant
Indeed  Carpark allows the management of all the vehicles from all the parks thanks to its database that includes all the information necessary about the vehicles from all the subsidiaries   the number plate  the intern references  but also the location of the maintenance  the maintenance plan that suits the vehicle the most according to the recommendation of the suppliers    Moreover  drivers also use Carpark in order to encode the kilometers travelled with the busses  which allows the automated planning of the maintenance every 15 000 or 30 000 kilometers  depending on the bus,Relevant
Those planned maintenances are sorted 1 500 kilometers in advance by the software in order for the technical and maintenance head to be able to plan their actual execution with the mechanics,Relevant
Of course  more completion dates can be added manually in accordance with a specific date of a specific number of kilometers travelled,Relevant
Lastly  Carpark keeps the history of all the maintenances and repairs that have been done on each vehicle,Relevant
The repair process starts with the transmission of a complaint through Carpark,Relevant
With this complaint  a driver signals a damage  a breakdown or an accident  after having made a research with the number of the vehicle in order to verify that the damage has not already been signaled and avoid any duplication,Relevant
The content of the complaint is the following   the problem  the vehicle concerned  its kilometers travelled  and  if the driver wants to  his email address or his phone number in order to receive a message when the complaint is taken in charge,Irrelevant
The technical and maintenance head can consult the list of all the complaints in Carpark,Irrelevant
He then decides of the moment the complaint has to be treated   depending on the urgency of the problem,Relevant
If the problem is considered as urgent  the technical and maintenance head directly visits the garage where the repair is going to be done in order to find mechanics who are available to take the bus in charge,Relevant
Otherwise  the repair is planned for a later day and will be taken in charge during the daily morning meeting between the technical and maintenance head and the mechanics where the work of the day is divided up,Relevant
The technical and maintenance head creates the workshop sheet related to each repair,Relevant
This sheet includes a description of the problem as well as the work that has to be done by the mechanics  and is identified by a specific codebare,Irrelevant
If the driver who transmitted the complaint gave a phone number or an email address  a message is automatically sent to him when the workshop sheet is created in order to let him know that the complaint is taken into account and that the bus is sent to the garage for repairs,Relevant
Following the daily planning of the mechanics  the technical and maintenance head sends the workshop sheets to the ones concerned by the repair,Relevant
With the use of a clocking software   each mechanic scans the barcode of the workshop sheet to indicate when he takes it in charge  and then when he is done with the execution of its content,Relevant
That enables the technical and maintenance head to know which repairs are ongoing and which ones are finished  but also to know the workforce that has been required for each of them,Irrelevant
Moreover  the mechanic indicates in the workshop sheet every piece that he used for the repair by scanning the barcode of them  which also allows an easy following of the evolution of the stock ,Relevant
Once the mechanic has finished the repairs  the completed workshop sheet is sent back to the technical and maintenance head who closes it,Relevant
That finally permits the creation of the invoice as well as the suppression of the complaint in the list in Carpark,Relevant
Of course  in order to make repairs on busses  it is essential to have efficient stock maintenance of the pieces required for those repairs,Irrelevant
It is the role of the technical and maintenance head to create the purchase orders  communicate them to the suppliers  take the delivery  control and approve the invoices,Relevant
Once a new piece arrives  either it is immediately used because it has been ordered for a specific repair that is ongoing or urgent  or the piece enters the stock,Relevant
Each piece of the stock is identified by a particular barcode  which is also useful to keep track of the pieces used during each repair  as mentioned previously   and has a particular place in the warehouse determined by a departement  a shelf and a level,Relevant
Keolis Belgium and its subsidiaries owns many gas stations with their fuel pumps  but they also manage the tankage of other stations in areas where they don t own any cistern,Irrelevant
This mix of their own tanks and the external tanks is centralized in one software  Telenaro   where the internal tanks are continuously updated  and the data from their external clients are imported two times a month,Relevant
Telenaro gathers all the societies  vehicles of the group  internal and external drivers  and data related   type of vehicle  maximum level of the fuel tank  baseline consumption  current consumption  and all the other details linked with the tankage,Relevant
That permits automated statistics about the consumption of fuel  as a way of efficient control despite the size of the entire group and the number of stations  vehicles and cisterns,Relevant
Moreover  the forecasting of the resupply of each cistern is based on an estimated range computed from the average daily consumption registered,Relevant
Lastly  Telenaro keeps the history of all the deliveries of fuel  the deltas given by the probes  see further   the alerts from problems during a delivery  etc,Relevant
Any anomaly in Telenaro can be corrected manually by an operator,Relevant
A new system of probes installed in some of the cisterns of the company gives an on live view of the fuel level,Relevant
In parallel to the probes  the level is also computed from the documented tanks and resupplies in Telenaro,Relevant
The delta between the probed level and the computed one allows the operators to identify any problems in the supply of fuel or in the tankage of some vehicles  i e  the amount of fuel delivered do not correspond to the one indicated on the invoice of the supplier   a driver tries to defraud by taking some fuel for its 7 own personal consumption   in winter  a quite big difference can come from the high consumption of the heaters for the scholar cars     ,Irrelevant
The probe of a cistern also detects if the amount of fuel varies whereas no delivery is ongoing because of a leak of fuel or a theft  which triggers an alarm,Relevant
It even gives the level of water in the cistern  due to the condensation in the cisterns  so that the operators know when they need to evacuate some of that water,Relevant
Most importantly  the probes replace the previously needed and costly physical presence of an operator in order to verify and control the proper conduct of each resupply,Relevant
The starting point of the resupply of a cistern is its low level of fuel,Irrelevant
To know if any tankage is required  the manager of a society can easily visualize the level of each cistern of its society thanks to Telenaro and its icons and colored level bars  see the adjacent illustration ,Irrelevant
In addition  the system automatically sends an alert to the manager when a particular level of fuel is reached whereas no tankage is planned yet,Relevant
When the operator decides that an order is needed   he calls for tenders  and the best price gets the order,Relevant
Then the manager makes the order to the supplier and sends an email to the subsidiaries in order to inform the local managers of the upcoming resupply,Relevant
All the ongoing orders are also registered in Telenaro,Relevant
When the delivery man arrives at the location of the delivery  the operator in charge at the station gives him the delivery probe that has to be scanned at the pump to allow the tankage as well as to confirm to Telenaro that the delivery is made,Relevant
After the tankage  the delivery man encodes the amount of fuel he just delivered  and the system will compare that amount to the one measured by the probe,Relevant
If they do not correspond  the system asks the delivery man to re encode the amount and makes the verification again,Relevant
After three times asking for re encodage  if the encoded amount and the probed amount still do not correspond  the system sends a message to the firm in order to signal it,Relevant
Then  the delivery is confirmed by the system to the operator in charge as well as to Telenaro,Relevant
The system automatically creates and sends the invoice to the society that benefited from the delivery  and a copy to the manager in charge so that he is able to control if the delivery corresponds to the negotiations made at the moment of the ordering,Relevant
It also generates the excise documents for the recovering as well as the official declaration for the Ministry,Relevant
When an operator from any department wants to make a purchase  he has to fill in an investment request,Relevant
Four different investment requests are used in Keolis Belgium for  ,Relevant
? Rolling stock  buses for regular lines  scholar lines  tourisms  but also trailers for the luggages   ,Relevant
? No rolling stock  supplies for the garages  tools  compressors   ,Relevant
? Properties  buildings  but also air conditioning  garage doors  led lights  bus wash   ,Relevant
? IT infrastructures  cabling  laptops  desktops  servers  magnetic access cards  surveillance cameras ,Relevant
See the annexes for samples of the four investment requests,Irrelevant
Once the investment request is completed  the amount of the expense is controlled by the purchase department regarding the budgetization of the year,Relevant
If the management validates the purchase  the investment request has now to be signed by the supervisor of the departments concerned by the purchase as well as a head of the purchase department in order to acknowledge the validation of the purely budgetary aspect,Relevant
Once the investment request has been signed  it is sent via email to the supplier that launches the delivery,Relevant
In order to close the process  the invoice still has to be validated by the purchase department that confirms the purchase,Relevant
The firm has a few master contracts with some suppliers  and all the subsidiaries are strongly encouraged to make their purchases through those master contracts as a priority,Irrelevant
Of course  case by case exceptions are possible but this tolerance toward the appeal to other suppliers is supervised   if a department constantly makes purchases with other suppliers that the ones concerned by the master contracts negotiated by the organisation  an operational manager or an head of the subsidiary will make sure it stops,Relevant
In fact  76% of the purchases of the organisation are made within master contracts,Irrelevant
For example  all the OPEX  Operational Expenditures  that concern office supplies are subject to master contracts,Irrelevant
If no master contract concerns the purpose of the purchase and if the amount if that purchase exceeds 5 000 euros  three offers generally have to be collected before making a choice of a supplier  in order to compare the price quality ratios  the delivery time  the quality of the after sales service  etc,Relevant
 here again  exceptions are of course possible ,Irrelevant
The final choice of a supplier is made by the purchase department in tandem with the ones who will benefit from the purchase,Relevant
Besides those master contracts  the company also has some price conventions and other pre negotiated purchase terms with some other suppliers,Irrelevant
Whenever the company wants to broaden the number of clients it reaches  the very first step concerns the work of the marketing team,Relevant
The aim is to get information about potential clients in order to determine if the company can propose valuable services to them and conclude an order,Irrelevant
This preparation is essential because it is the foundation of the sale process   the sales representatives from the commercial team have to be well prepared for the coming negotiation,Irrelevant
Once the information has been collected through market analysis  the commercial team contacts the potential client and a first negotiation takes place,Relevant
The aim is to determine whether the client is interested by the potential offer  and the sales representative bases its argumentation on the client analysis previously communicated by the marketing department,Relevant
After the negotiation and if the client is indeed interested  a first offer is created,Relevant
This offer needs to be signed by several managers   if the offer is not appropriated  it might compromise the sale,Relevant
After having been signed  the offer is sent to the client by email,Relevant
If the client directly accepts the offer  the sale is validated and the processes of invoicing and delivering can start,Relevant
But if the client is not entirely satisfied with the proposition  more negotiations can take place in order to have the approval of the client  while still respecting the frames and goals from the management,Relevant
Repeating the last circle several times would be very heavy due to the long approbation chain   but that almost never occurs   generally  if the second offer is still not validated by the client  the sale is cancelled,Relevant
Empty bottles are returned by the customers  once the bottles are received we sort the types of bottles before washing them afterwards  we control the cleanliness of the bottles and the quality of the bottles with a laser to detect the slightest defect,Relevant
If the bottles have defects  they are rejected and if not  they are kept,Relevant
Then the bottles are filled  captured  labelled and marked with the expiry date,Relevant
Then the bottles go to the warehouse for storage,Relevant
AB Inbev needs bottles so they will order the bottles from their suppliers,Relevant
The suppliers check the order if it is accepted  a confirmation is sent to AB Inbev  then the suppliers plan the transportation  then they send the invoice and at the same time the bottles are delivered by truck to AB Inbev,Relevant
Once the trucks are received  AB Inbev unload the trucks and then they check the goods  if everything is good  the bottles are stored  if not  AB Inbev sends the bad products back to the suppliers and the suppliers will send a new invoice and the good products or missing products to AB Inbev who will unload the trucks  check the goods before storing them,Relevant
purchase order is received at the logistics department  if it is a new customer  it has to be entered into the VPO System which is used by all AB Inbev breweries,Relevant
The VPO manager will then send the order information to the warehouse  which will then check the availability of the beer for the order,Relevant
If everything is available  the order is prepared  otherwise a request is sent to the packaging department to produce the missing beer,Relevant
Once the beer is ready  it is delivered and the invoice is sent to the customer,Relevant
AB InBev receives unsolicited applications but also via other channels  Indeed and Forem   the People department receives applications,Relevant
1  CV screening consists of the elimination of CVs that do not meet the criteria requested by the company  and when information is missing we send an e mail to warn the candidate,Relevant
If they do not meet the criteria  their application will not have been selected,Relevant
2  The telephone interview  the recruiter will contact the selected candidates by telephone  5 10 minutes ,Relevant
If he is convinced  he will invite the candidate to the recruitment morning,Relevant
3  The recruitment morning is a collective interview  there is a series of tests,Relevant
Successful candidates are contacted by telephone to invite them to the next interview with the N 1 or N 2,Relevant
4  Interview with the department manager   The manager turns his interview more towards the personality of the candidate,Relevant
If the candidate is accepted  he or she is invited to a training course,Relevant
5  Form Alim  training  Form Alim is a training course specially created for production operators in the food industry,Irrelevant
6  The first  seasonal  contract and coaching  When signing the contract  the candidate is invited to the People Department to complete documents,Relevant
7  The permanent contract  If the employee receives a sufficient number of positive feedbacks  his manager is satisfied with his work and ABI has the opportunity to do so  he will be offered a permanent contract,Relevant
Different types of malts are put together in the tank,Relevant
They are crushed in order to extract the fermentable sugar,Relevant
The resulting product is then mixed with heated water in a vat,Relevant
Then the liquid is pumped into another tank in which the husks of the grains are separated from the suicidal liquid,Relevant
The liquid obtained is then subjected to strong heat in a kettle,Relevant
After this step  we will be able to proceed to the fermentation process  we will add hops and yeast which will convert the sugar into beer  then we will cool the beer  filter it and add CO2 to make the beer sparkling,Relevant
So all that remains is to wait until the beer is mature  3 weeks  before it can be sold and consumed,Relevant
The aim of this process is to answer  positively or not  to an employee s holiday request,Irrelevant
The process starts when an employee makes a request which is received by a human resource analyst,Relevant
The analyst takes charge of the request by changing its state to « pending »  which means that the demand is neither approved nor rejected,Relevant
Then  the request is sent to the manager of the requester s department,Relevant
This is the first step that the request has to go through,Irrelevant
If the manager rejects the request  the analyst changes its state to « rejected » and the process ends with a notification sent to the employee,Relevant
Otherwise  if the manager accepts the request  the analyst changes the state of the request to « approved » and the first step is done,Relevant
After that  the request also has to be granted by the human resource manager,Relevant
The aim of this process is to allocate human resources to a specific task,Irrelevant
To understand it properly  it is common sense yet important to note a human resource cannot be assigned to a project if this one doesn t already exist,Irrelevant
In the same way  we cannot create a project before having a customer to which it relates,Irrelevant
So in the most common cases  the manager will want to allocate a human resource to a specific project  so he is going to trigger the process by its higher start event,Relevant
Then  he is going to create and fulfill the new resource page and add it on the project,Relevant
That leads straightly to the higher end event and this is the shortest way to go through the process,Relevant
Otherwise  if  after trying to create this page  the software realizes that this new resource doesn t refer to an existing project  the process leads the analyst to the creation of this one,Relevant
This is the role of the first gateway,Irrelevant
After successfully filling each step  the process brings back the analyst on the first line and to the first end event,Relevant
In the same way  if  during the creation of a new project  the software realizes that this project doesn t relate to a registered customer  then the process leads the analyst in the encoding of this new customer,Relevant
This is the role of the purple gateway,Irrelevant
After having registered this new customer  the process brings the employee back to the second and then to the first line that leads again to the first end event,Relevant
Of course we could imagine the case where the analyst would only want to create a new project or to register a new customer without immediately allocating a resource to it,Irrelevant
This is the role of the second and the third start events  which respectively leads to the second and third end events,Irrelevant
This business process is triggered when the training manager wants to create a training,Relevant
If the training has not already been taught in the past  then the manager has to create a whole new training,Relevant
 cfr linked subprocess ,Irrelevant
Otherwise  the manager only has to schedule the session of related training  called then a session  and contact the external trainer of his choice  specialized in this field,Relevant
As the attendance needs to be recorded for obvious financial and organizational reasons  the manager establishes a list of attendees thanks to the form sent earlier on and the IT training system,Relevant
1 week before the training s day  a reminder is sent by email to the attendees,Relevant
After the session  the manager has to perform 3 tasks simultaneously  ask for a debrief  apply the post training process and update attendees  skills in the database,Relevant
That being done  the whole process finally ends,Relevant
Subprocess   If a training has not been given yet on a particular subject in the past  the manager has to design the training and fill a form with the details of it,Relevant
If the HR director does not accept the training framework for various reasons  the training being too expensive  too time consuming for the human resources etc   the manager has to re evaluate it and redesign the training,Relevant
Otherwise  the manager can select the language the training will be given in  French  English or both ,Relevant
Finally  he has to save the choices made before and this creates the training in their IT training system,Relevant
This BPMN is relative to the internal invoicing and the payment of an internal contract,Irrelevant
It happens when an entity of the group ARHS offers its services to another entity,Relevant
The accounting officer of the entity providing its services receives the  framework  which is the name given to an internal contract from the indebted entity s accounting department,Relevant
The latter selects lines corresponding to the framework and records it in  Interco  which is the software used for internal contracts,Relevant
After that  the accounting officer clicks on the button  send to invoice  and the invoice is registered as  to be received  in  FICO  which is the general accountancy software,Relevant
Finally  the accounting officer waits for the payment and sends a reminder after 30 days of waiting to the indebted entity,Relevant
They do not charge any kind of late fees to each other as they are all part of the same group,Irrelevant
Once it is received  the invoice gets archived,Relevant
If the company finds an interesting profile  the HR employee searches for information about them  creates a proposal  and sends them an email,Relevant
If the person rejects the proposal or does not respond to it within three weeks  the process ends,Relevant
However  if they accept the proposal  the human resources employee calls them to set up a meeting a week later,Relevant
Once the interview has been made  the HR employee arranges a visit to the company for a moment later,Relevant
Once the visit and the interview have been carried out  a skills test for the potential future employee has to be taken,Relevant
Depending on their result  the company decides whether to hire them or not,Relevant
If the answer is yes  the company considers a contract proposal and calls the candidate to discuss it,Relevant
The company is then awaiting for their response,Relevant
The latter can accept or refuse the contract,Irrelevant
If the answer is negative  a new call is scheduled to renegotiate the employment clauses,Relevant
If accepted  the employee is hired and their profile is registered in the company system,Relevant
Another way to get into the hiring process is to apply through an online form on the company website or to spontaneously apply to the company,Relevant
In the first case  the documents of the applicants  their CV and the online form will be analyzed by a human resources employee,Relevant
In the second case  the employee will only analyze the documents and CVs of the applicants,Relevant
Based on these documents  the employee decides whether or not to go on with the process by calling the candidate if selected,Relevant
The process starts when a message from the MRP system2 is received,Relevant
Indeed  to manufacture a pump for a customer  they need material resources  and the MRP system knows it so it sends notifications to the central purchasing department that will then take care of this information,Relevant
Then  three activities have to be done in parallel   Create an X Flow3  Request for quotation to the supplier  Do a framework agreement price matrix  it is done to calculate costs of the pump ,Relevant
When these 3 tasks are completed  the company places an order with its supplier who then takes care of the delivery,Relevant
Then the product is sent to the quality control to check the quality of the products received,Relevant
If the quality does not meet the expectations  they are sent back to the supplier and the supplier delivers better products or does some repairs on them,Relevant
If the quality is good  they are sent to the Central purchasing department with the invoice,Relevant
When the invoice is received  they have to validate the invoice in order to confirm that everything is ok and matches the information in the X Flow  which allows the accounting department to free up money and the process ends like this,Relevant
The process starts when the planning department receives a sales order from the customer,Relevant
They are then able to prepare a preliminary planning and to give feedback to the project manager for the kick off meeting  KOM ,Relevant
Then  the master planner attends the KOM and  thanks to the minutes of meeting  MOM  that he receives by mail  he can update the planning and save a deadlines baseline that contains all the project s milestones,Relevant
The planning department can then launch the production order by putting it into the SAP system,Relevant
Then  meetings take place each week until the end of the production,Relevant
In case there are delays due to some modifications in the plan of the pump or delays due to late deliveries from the supplier  the project manager is informed and he gives this information to the planning department,Relevant
The planning is then updated,Relevant
The whole company is supposed to follow this planning and to act according to it,Irrelevant
The process ends when the pump is done,Relevant
The process starts when an idea of conception comes to the mind of somebody in the business unit,Relevant
Then the business unit makes a project proposal  and a detailed analysis is done,Relevant
Then the product development team does the technical specifications and after that the stakeholders make an analysis of the product and decide whether it is feasible or not,Relevant
If they say that it is infeasible  the process ends,Relevant
But if it is feasible  then the business unit  the product development team and the operations and procurement team meet during a kick off meeting to talk about the project,Relevant
Then  those three teams work together in order to make a deeper analysis and conceptual generic drawings,Relevant
Then  they still work together to set up a detailed drawing with technical specifications this time,Relevant
When those tasks are done  the product development team realises final manufacturing drawings with all the composing parts,Relevant
Then the three teams above mentioned have to gather all the data to put it in the manufacturing file,Relevant
After all these activities  the pump is ready to be sold so the product development team puts it in the product catalogue and the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when the production order is received from the SAP system,Relevant
The workers can then take the raw parts needed for a specific pump in the warehouse,Relevant
When it is done  they send a notification to inform the SAP system that this step of the production is done,Relevant
Then the system sends a work order to the workers in the machining service and two activities are done in parallel   the transformation of raw parts that is done by the workers and the one that is done by the subcontractor,Relevant
When all the pieces are transformed by the subcontractor or by the workers  they can store those finished materials in the warehouse and once again inform the SAP system,Relevant
Then they receive another work order from SAP to pre assemble the pump,Relevant
When it is done  they store the subsets and inform SAP,Relevant
Once again they receive a work order  and they have to do two activities in parallel   do the piping and assemble the bareshaft pump4,Relevant
Then when those two activities are done  they can assemble the final pump and check its performance thanks to an internal and an external quality controller,Relevant
If the performance is of good quality  the pump is dispatched,Relevant
A notification is then sent to SAP and the process ends,Relevant
If the performance is poor  they solve the problem and then they check again if it is ok,Relevant
The process starts when the customer notifies a problem to the after sales department,Relevant
They receive the defective material at the plant and they create a file,Relevant
Then  they are able to estimate a quote,Relevant
The next step is assessing the problem,Relevant
If the problem comes from the customer  the warranty will not be applied but if the company is responsible for it  the customer will have to pay nothing for the repairs,Relevant
In the case where the customer is under warranty  they apply it,Relevant
If he is not under warranty  a final quote is set up and the customer has to accept or to reject it,Relevant
If he rejects the quote  the file is closed and the material is sent back,Relevant
The company can still charge him for the time they spent on the pump  so they can also create an invoice before sending back the material,Relevant
In the case where he accepts the quote  or right after having applied the warranty  they create a work order  WO ,Relevant
Then they get the material they need to do the repairs thanks to the central purchasing,Relevant
Then they have to consider if those are small or big repairs,Relevant
If a big repair has to be done  they go on site to do it because of practical reasons  then they create the invoice and the process ends,Relevant
If it is only small repairs  they do it at Sulzer s workshop and then they send back the material,Relevant
Once it is done  they create the invoice and the process ends,Relevant
Before really getting into the recruitment process  it is important to know that Resultance tries its best to approach young people,Irrelevant
To do this Resultance is present in schools and on various recruitment sites to promote the company and attract young people,Irrelevant
The recruitment process takes place in several stages,Irrelevant
Applications are received by the HR managers  who then sort and select the best applications,Relevant
Once an application is selected  an interview is set up between the candidate and the HR managers,Relevant
Then the candidates selected after the first interview are interviewed by a partner of the firm,Relevant
Once the candidate has been selected  the integration phase begins  the candidate will receive a salary package from the HR department  and a mentor will be appointed to supervise the new candidate and help him or her integrate as well as possible,Relevant
A form is sent to all members of the firm to inform them of the arrival of a new employee,Relevant
The integration process  On the first day  the employee is welcomed by the HR department and the administrative assistant,Relevant
The employee is given his or her work tools  mobile phone  PC  car  and is explained the IT tools used at Resultance,Relevant
They are told what they need to know about the firm  the company s values are explained to them and they receive their assignment,Relevant
He will be attached to a project and will know the manager who is going to supervise it,Relevant
The welcome continues with the godfather or godmother over a meal to immediately create a relationship and ensure that the new employee is well integrated,Relevant
The employee is then monitored and supervised by his or her manager and feedback is given to ensure that he or she develops well,Relevant
A diagnosis is launched at the customer s premises  an employee will describe the company  its level of performance in the different departments,Relevant
Risks at the level of processes and organisation will be assessed,Relevant
The intensity of the changes will also be highlighted by the employees responsible for the diagnosis,Relevant
To do this Resultance uses the SWOT tool and focuses on the opportunities,Irrelevant
Once the diagnosis has been established  the employees will share the findings and recommendations resulting from the client s analysis,Relevant
From this moment on  improvement paths will be described and will reveal the quantitative and qualitative gains that can be made,Relevant
Then a member of staff will draw up a detailed action plan in the form of a gantt chart for each area of improvement,Relevant
Once the diagnosis has been made  the areas for improvement put forward  it is up to the management team to decide whether or not to take action,Relevant
The diagnosis will make it possible to define the duration of the mission and the number of employees required for the project,Relevant
Based on this  an estimate can be drawn up and presented to the client,Relevant
Based on the investigation and on a formal decision taken by the management team  a project is launched,Relevant
Resultance pursues the analysis of the client s company in order to gain credibility and establishes the collaborative relationship,Irrelevant
The employees responsible for the project build new tools  propose new working methods and processes,Relevant
Workshops are set up at the client s premises to directly involve stakeholders in the changes proposed by Resultance employees,Relevant
Each new proposal must be validated by the steering committee  responsible for ensuring that a project runs smoothly within a company ,Relevant
The tools are then deployed in the field,Relevant
In order to ensure that the methodologies are properly transformed into results  Resultance employees working at the client s site set up and lead the teams to ensure that the new tools are actually implemented,Relevant
The teams are monitored until they reach the objectives set by Resultance,Relevant
This ensures a real collaborative relationship between Resultance and the client,Irrelevant
To ensure that the project runs smoothly  a meeting is held once a week with the Resultance project manager and the client s internal project manager,Relevant
This makes it possible  for example  to resolve any problems immediately if there are any,Irrelevant
In addition to this  every 4 to 6 weeks  a steering committee  with the management committee of the client company  is set up to take stock of the actions carried out in the project  to take stock of progress and any problems encountered,Relevant
This monitoring makes it possible to give new directions to the project or change priorities,Irrelevant
And finally  Resultance ensures the proper transfer of knowledge and tools put in place to ensure sustainability,Relevant
The client is then autonomous and benefits from continuous improvement,Irrelevant
When a new employee joins the company  his or her objectives and expectations are entered into the database of a tool called  Workday ,Relevant
This tool centralizes and automates all the decisions related to human resources management such as managing holidays and leaves  evaluations  sending reminder for deadlines and registering automated approvals,Relevant
In addition  this process requires little or no supervision,Irrelevant
This process of human resources management ends when the employee leaves GSK,Relevant
Once a customer has placed an order  the documents related to the purchase are received at the factory while the documents related to transport and the products  badge with date of production and expiry date  are handled manually,Relevant
The warehouse verifies on paper that the data on the pallets is consistent with the order,Relevant
Then  the papers are scanned and sent to the quality team,Relevant
The quality team makes verifications before signing and archiving the file,Relevant
After that  the products related to the order can be released,Relevant
This process starts when a client requests a pricing offer to the local Belgian GSK team,Relevant
An employee receives the request and prepares a pricing offer,Relevant
Then  according to the 4 eyes principle  another employee from the Belgian team checks the offer,Relevant
If there is a discrepancy  the offer is corrected,Relevant
When the offer is finally approved  it is sent to the central team in India to copy it in SAP,Relevant
The central team signals that the offer is confirmed to the local Belgian team by email,Relevant
When this email is received in Belgium  the offer is confirmed to the client,Relevant
There are 3 possibilities for GSK to receive an order for their products from a customer ,Relevant
 The customer can place his order through a sales representative of GSK during a physical visit,Relevant
This case applies mainly to the pharmacies,Irrelevant
The representative encodes the order on a tablet connected to the GSK ordering system,Relevant
 The customer can also place orders by e mailing the company,Relevant
When the e mail is received  the customer service checks the availability of the products ordered,Relevant
The order is checked and sent to the warehouse if the items are in stock,Relevant
In case of shortage  the customer is of course notified,Relevant
 The third possibility consists in the customer using GSK s platform thanks to a personal identifier interfaced with EDI  Electronic Data Interchange ,Relevant
Once the order is confirmed  it is sent to the warehouse,Relevant
After receiving the order  the warehouse verifies that the information is correct,Relevant
Then  a staff member in the warehouse picks up the different articles with a cart,Relevant
Once the products are picked up  they are boxed and packed,Relevant
Then  the order is placed on pallets to be delivered to the customer,Relevant
The tracking of the order and the expected delivery time can be consulted at any time by the customer thanks to the label on the order,Irrelevant
When the products are received by the customer  the invoice is sent,Relevant
This process starts when a customer has a complaint about the price or the quantity of one order,Relevant
He or she has to contact the customer service,Relevant
Even if the contact is made by phone  an e mail has to be sent to have a written proof of the complaint,Relevant
Then  the customer service has to ask the sales manager if the correct price was applied the right quantity was sent,Relevant
If it is  the process ends with sending an email of rejection of complaint to the costumer,Relevant
If the price quantity is not correct  the customer service generates a credit note and send it to the sales manager who has to print sign scan before sending it back to the customer service,Relevant
Then the customer service also has to print sign scan send it and reimburse the customer,Relevant
The law obliges GSK to keep proof of the complaint for 7 years,Irrelevant
This storage is currently done through paper format documents,Irrelevant
There are two ways to find out something is missing,Irrelevant
Due to the digital transformation  most of the inventory is automatically done at the end of the day,Irrelevant
So  every morning  the supply manager  when he sees the ERP alert  purchases the products missing  or practically missing ,Relevant
The manager is constantly prospecting but if something is missing  he does not have the time to ask every supplier to make a quote  that is a support activity,Relevant
The other way to find out something is missing is by a warehouse worker,Relevant
Thanks to ERP  it is hardly happening,Irrelevant
But  if while he is picking products  something is missing or the quality is not good enough  he will directly alert the supply manager so he will purchase new ones,Relevant
Suppliers are listed in the  supplier database   where the manager can retrieve which product is from which supplier,Irrelevant
The invoice is finally sent to the financial department where it will be paid,Relevant
Most of the leads are firstly received by a telemarketer by mail or by a phone call,Relevant
They will take the information about the client and insert them into the  Customer database ,Relevant
We will assume that every lead is about B2B,Irrelevant
If the client does not need delivery or a quote  he should go to the  cash and carry  shop in Droixhe,Relevant
The telemarketer will then send the address of the delivery to receive a day of delivery for the client,Relevant
If for some reason  the day proposed by the transporter does not suit the client  the financial department will analyze if it could  economically  be possible to charter a truck just for him,Relevant
If not  the lead will be aborted,Relevant
If the client agrees and does not need a physical appointment  the telemarketer will make a quote,Relevant
Otherwise  he will attribute the client to a salesman available who will set an appointment and make the quote,Relevant
When the first quote is made  by the salesman or the telemarketer  the client might refuse it or accept it,Relevant
If the client accepts it  the contract will be signed  and the order made,Relevant
If not  he might not be interested anymore and the case would be closed  or he might want a better quote,Relevant
The salesman telemarketer will need approval from the financial department to lower prices or make a promotion,Relevant
If it is not possible to do a better quote  the case will be closed,Relevant
If it is  the salesman telemarketer will make the new quote which might  once again  be approved or refused by the client,Relevant
And so on  until the client declined the offer or consented to it,Relevant
When the order arrived at the warehouse  if there are some products that need to be pre commanded  the manager will do so  and the order will be handled as soon as delivered,Relevant
Otherwise  he will assign the order to an available worker,Relevant
He will receive the order on his scanner,Relevant
It indicates the emplacement of products and their quantity,Irrelevant
If the product needed is not there  the work must advise the manager so he can report the error  corrects the database  and purchases the product needed,Relevant
Every time the picker picks something  he must check the quality and the expiration date in order to avoid any return,Relevant
When all the products of the order are picked  the worker needs to check that the weight and the volume correspond to what is expected by the ERP,Relevant
Then  if everything is right  the worker will confirm the order and emit the shipment order,Relevant
If the order is canceled  the financial department will determine the cancelation penalty and charge it to the customer  and if the product was not shipped yet  the manager will handle the product return,Relevant
When the order is delivered  the transporter sends a delivery note to the financial department,Relevant
Then  every Monday  they emit the invoice for every customer delivered,Relevant
If after 14 days  they still do not have the payment  they will send a reminder,Relevant
If after another 14 days  the order is still unpaid  the debt recovery will start and the client will be stuck,Relevant
