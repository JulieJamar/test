The party sends a warrant possession request asking a warrant to be released,1
The Client Service Back Office as part of the Small Claims Registry Operations receives the request and retrieves the SCT file,1
Then the SCT Warrant Possession is forwarded to Queensland Police,1
The SCT physical file is stored by the Back Office awaiting a report to be sent by the Police,1
When the report is received the respective SCT file is retrieved,1
Then Back Office attaches the new SCT document and stores the expanded SCT physical file,1
After that some other MC internal staff receives the physical SCT file (out of scope),1
These are received by the Secretariat in the central inbox and forwarded after a short visual inspection to an accounting employee,1
In ACME Financial Accounting a software specially developed for the ACME AG she identifies the charging suppliers and creates a new instance (invoice),1
She then checks the invoice items and notes the corresponding cost center at the ACME AG and the related cost center managers for each position on a separate form (docket),1
The docket and the copy of the invoice go to the internal mail together and are sent to the first cost center manager to the list,1
He reviews the content for accuracy after receiving the copy of the invoice,1
Should everything be in order he notes his code one on the docket (accurate position - AP) and returns the copy of the invoice to the internal mail,1
From it the copy of the invoice is passed on to the next cost center manager based on the docket or if all items are marked correct sent back to accounting,1
Therefore the copy of invoice and the docket gradually move through the hands of all cost center managers until all positions are marked as completely accurate,1
However if inconsistencies exist e.g. because the ordered product is not of the expected quantity or quality the cost center manager rejects the AP with a note and explanatory statement on the docket and the copy of the invoice is sent back to accounting directly,1
Based on the statements of the cost center managers she will proceed with the clarification with the vendor but if necessary she consults the cost center managers by telephone or e-mail again,1
When all inconsistencies are resolved the copy of the invoice is sent to the cost center managers again and the process continues,1
After all invoice items are AP the accounting employee forwards the copy of the invoice to the commercial manager,1
He makes the commercial audit and issues the approval for payment,1
If the bill amount exceeds EUR 20 000 the Board wants to check it again (4-eyes-principle),1
The copy of the invoice including the docket moves back to the accounting employee in the appropriate signature file,1
Should there be a complaint during the commercial audit it will be resolved by the accounting employee with the supplier,1
After the commercial audit is successfully completed the accounting employee gives payment instructions and closes the instance in ACME financial accounting,1
The loan approval process starts by receiving a customer request for a loan amount,1
The risk assessment Web service is invoked to assess the request,1
If the loan is small and the customer is low risk the loan is approved,1
If the customer is high risk the loan is denied,1
If the customer needs further review or the loan amount is for $10 000 or more the request is sent to the approver Web service,1
The customer receives feedback from the assessor or approver,1
The process of Vacations Request starts when any employee of the organization submits a vacation request,1
Once the requirement is registered the request is received by the immediate supervisor of the employee requesting the vacation,1
The supervisor must approve or reject the request,1
If the request is rejected the application is returned to the applicant/employee who can review the rejection reasons,1
If the request is approved a notification is generated to the Human Resources Representative who must complete the respective management procedures,1
The process of Vacations Request starts when any employee of the organization submits a vacation request,1
Once the requirement is registered the request is received by the immediate supervisor of the employee requesting the vacation,1
The supervisor must approve or reject the request,1
If the request is rejected the process will end,1
If the request is asked to make a change then it is returned to the petitioner/employee who can review the comments for the change request,1
If the request is approved it will go to the purchase department that will be in charge of making quotations (using a subprocess) and select a vendor,1
If the vendor is not valid in the system the purchase department will have to choose a different vendor,1
After a vendor is selected and confirmed the system will generate and send a purchase order and wait for the product to be delivered and the invoice received,1
In any case the system will send a notification to let the user know what the result was,1
In any of the cases approval rejection or change required the system will send the user a notification,1
First the Manager checks the open leads,1
Afterwards he selects the top five ones,1
He then tells his Sales Assistant to call the contact person of the leads,1
The Sales Assistant calls each customer,1
If someone is interested he sends a note to the Manager,1
The Manager then processes the lead,1
Otherwise he calls the next customer,1
The customer enters the withdrawal amount,1
The ATM returns cash to the customer and changes his account balance,1
If the balance on customer’s account is less than the withdrawal amount the ATM returns an error,1
In a bowl mix the lemon juice olive oil Dijon mustard garlic red bell pepper salt and pepper,1
Set aside 1/4 cup of the mixture to use for basting,1
Place chicken in the bowl and marinate at least 20 minutes in the refrigerator,1
Preheat grill for high heat,1
Lightly oil grill grate,1
Drain and discard marinade from the bowl and place chicken on the grill,1
Cook to minutes on each side until juices run clear basting occasionally with the reserved marinade,1
An employee purchases a product or service he requires,1
The employee submits an expense report with a list of items along with the receipts for each item,1
A supervisor reviews the expense report and approves or rejects the report,1
If the supervisor rejects the report the employee who submitted it is given a chance to edit it,1
If the supervisor approves the report it goes to the treasurer,1
The treasurer checks that all the receipts have been submitted and match the items on the list,1
If all is in order the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing,1
If receipts are missing or do not match the report he sends it back to the employee,1
If a report returns to the employee for corrections it must again go to a supervisor even if the supervisor previously approved the report,1
If the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing the report moves to an automatic activity that links to a payment system,1
The process waits for the payment confirmation,1
After the payment is confirmed the process ends,1
Every time we get a new order from the sales department first one of my masters determines the necessary parts and quantities as well as the delivery date,1
Once that information is present it has to be entered into our production planning system (PPS),1
It optimizes our production processes and creates possibly uniform work packages so that the setup times are minimized,1
Besides it creates a list of parts to be procured,1
so the data must be transferred manually,1
Once all the data is present we need to decide whether any parts are missing and must be procured or if this is not necessary,1
Once production is scheduled to start we receive a notice from the system and an employee takes care of the implementation,1
Finally the order will be checked again for its quality,1
The intake workflow starts with a notice by telephone at the secretarial office of the mental health care institute,1
The secretarial worker inquires after the name and residence of the patient,1
On the basis of this information the doctor is put through to the nursing officer responsible for the part of the region that the patient lives in,1
The nursing officer makes a full inquiry into the mental health and social state of the patient in question,1
This information is recorded on a registration form,1
At the end of the conversation this form is handed in at the secretarial office of the institute,1
Here the information on the form is stored in the information system and subsequently printed,1
For new patients a patient file is created,1
At the secretarial office two registration cards are produced for respectively the future first and second intaker of the patient,1
The new patient is added on the list of new notices,1
Halfway the week at Wednesday a staff meeting of the entire medical team takes place,1
At this meeting the team-leader assigns all new patients on the list of new notices to members of the team,1
The assignments are recorded on an assignment list which is handed to the secretarial office,1
For each new assignment it is also determined whether the medical file of the patient is required,1
This information is added to the assignment list,1
The secretarial office stores the assignment of each patient of the assignment list in the information system,1
It passes the produced registration cards to the first and second intaker of each newly assigned patient,1
For each patient for which the medical file is required the secretarial office prepares and sends a letter to the family doctor of the patient requesting for a copy of the medical file,1
As soon as this copy is received the secretarial office will inform the second intaker and add the copy to the patient file,1
The first intaker plans a meeting with the patient as soon as this is possible,1
During the first meeting the patient is examined using a standard checklist which is filled out,1
Additional observations are registered in a personal notebook,1
After a visit the first intaker puts a copy of these notes in the file of a patient,1
The standard checklist is also added to the patients file,1
The second intaker plans the first meeting only after the medical information of the physician -if required -has been received,1
Physicians use dictaphones to record their observations made during meetings with patients,1
The secretarial office types out these tapes after which the information is added to the patient file,1
As soon as the meetings of the first and second intaker with the patient have taken place the secretarial office puts the patient on the list of patients that reach this status,1
For the staff meeting on Wednesday they provide the team-leader with a list of these patients,1
For each of these patients the first and second intaker together with the team-leader and the attending psychiatrist formulate a treatment plan,1
This treatment plan formally ends the intake procedure,1
At the beginning the customer perceives that her subscribed service has degraded,1
A list with all the problem parameters is then sent to the Customer Service department of TELECO,1
At the customer service an employee enters (based on the received data) a problem report into system T,1
Then the problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are,1
Based on this the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities,1
An electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship,1
In case the customer is premium the process will link to an extra problem fix process,1
In case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures -otherwise the process continues,1
Taking together the information a detailed problem report is created,1
The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management,1
Service Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers,1
After receiving the detailed problem report Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning,1
In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning,1
If Service Management is sure they can analyze it they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem,1
After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report it is checked whether there are any possible problems,1
If no problems are detected a notification about the normal service execution is created,1
If a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created,1
Either trouble report or the ‘normal execution’ notification will be included in a status report and sent back to Service Management,1
Service Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information,1
Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report,1
For the case that no problem was detected at all the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service,1
For the case that minor corrective actions are required Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves,1
Subsequently the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service,1
After sending this process path of Service Management ends,1
For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration,1
This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning,1
Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process,1
After the restoration request is received all possible errors are tracked,1
Based on the tracked errors all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning,1
Then a trouble-shooting report is created,1
This report is sent out to Service Management then the process ends,1
The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii),1
Customer Service either receives the actual service performance (if there was no problem) or the problem resolution report,1
Then two concurrent activities are triggered i.e. i) a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem and ii) an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing,1
The report for the customer is sent out to her,1
After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service,1
After the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service the process flow at the customer also ends,1
The process is initiated by a switch-over request,1
In doing so the customer transmits his data to the customer service department of the company,1
The customer data is received by customer service and based on this data a customer data object is entered into the CRM system,1
After customer data has been entered it should then be compared with the internal customer data base and checked for completeness and plausibility,1
In case of any errors these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list,1
In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base a new customer object is being created which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow,1
The generated customer object is then used in combination with other customer data to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch,1
In the following an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS (customer information system) in order to confirm their successful generation,1
In case of a negative response the causing issues are being analyzed and resolved,1
Subsequently the contract documents are generated once again,1
In case of a positive response a confirmation document is sent out to the customer stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed,1
A request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the CIS,1
It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future,1
The switch-over request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence and the grid operator transmits a response comment,1
In the case of supplier concurrence the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the resolution of the conflict,1
The grid operator communicates with the old supplier and carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier,1
If there are not any objections by the grid operator customer service creates a CIS contract,1
The customer then has the chance to check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it,1
Depending on the customer’s acceptance/rejection the process flow at customer service either ends (in case of withdrawal) or continues (in case of a confirmation),1
After the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues,1
On the switch-date but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption report,1
At the same time the grid operator computes the final billing based on the meter data and sends it to the old supplier,1
Likewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer,1
For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then,1
After receiving the meter data customer service imports the meter data to systems that require the information,1
The process of “winning” a new customer ends here,1
Sometimes we buy details for cold calls sometimes our marketing staff participates in exhibitions and sometimes you just happen to know somebody who is interested in the product,1
Then we start calling the customer,1
That is done by the call center staff,1
They are determining the contact person and the budget which would be available for the project,1
Of course asking the customer whether he is generally interested is also important,1
If this is not the case we leave him alone except if the potential project budget is huge,1
Then the head of development personally tries to acquire the customer,1
If the customer is interested in the end the next step is a detailed online presentation,1
Afterwards we are waiting for the customer to come back to us,1
If we are not contacted within 2 weeks a sales representative is calling the customer,1
The last phase is the creation of a quotation,1
The credit company receives the credit information from the customer If the requested amount is greater than 1M$ an approval must be requested,1
If the requested amount is lower or equal to 1M$ the company assess the risk of the credit,1
After the assessment if the risk is high an approval must be requested but if the risk is low the credit is accepted,1
After the approval request the credit could be accepted or rejected in both cases an email is sent to the customer,1
The credit company collects the credit information from the customer If the requested amount is greater than 1M$ an approval must be requested,1
If the requested amount is lower or equal to 1M$ the company assess the risk of the credit,1
After the assessment if the risk is high an approval must be requested but if the risk is low the credit is accepted,1
After the approval request the credit could be accepted or rejected in both cases an email is sent to the customer,1
The credit company collects the credit information from the customer If the requested amount is lower or equal to 1M$ the company assess the risk of the credit,1
After the assessment if the risk is low the credit is accepted,1
If the requested amount is greater than 1M$ or the risk of the credit is high an approval must be requested,1
After the approval request the credit could be accepted or rejected in both cases an email is sent to the customer,1
If a not collected bag is identified CVS must check the number of resolution retries conducted,1
If the number of retries is greater than an specified number the bag must be returned to the production area for disassemble in all other cases CVS must try to contact the customer by phone and remind to pick up the bag,1
If the contact is successful and the customer withdrawn the order the bag must be returned to the production area for disassemble but if it is successful and the customer promises to pick up the bag CVS must increase the retry count on the bag label,1
Also this number must be increased if the contact is unsuccessful,1
As soon as an employee files an expense report the process is started,1
Once the expense report is received a check is performed to make sure the employee has an account,1
If this check does not take place within 28 days the process is stopped and the employee is sent a “resubmit” email,1
When the employee has an account the report is reviewed,1
If the employee does not have an account an account is created after which the report is reviewed,1
A check is performed to see if the amount of the expense exceeds 200,1
If it does not exceed 200 the employee is reimbursed through a deposit directly to the employee’s bank account and the process is ended,1
In the case that it does exceed 200 a supervisor is asked for approval,1
Three things can happen after this,1
First the supervisor approves within 7 days this will result in the deposit of the reimbursement directly to the employee’s bank account,1
Once this is done the process is ended,1
Second the supervisor rejects within 7 days as a result the employee receives a notification through email that the request has been rejected,1
Third if it takes the supervisor more than 7 days to respond an email is sent to the employee informing him/her that the approval is in progress and the part of the processes after a supervisor is asked for approval is repeated,1
At the end of every week the Payment Office of SSP generates a payment report and then pays the vendor,1
This payment report is sent automatically to clients (including the payment invoice) also the payment office must send the payment report to both the Registry office and to the Accounts Receivable Department,1
The Accounts Receivable Department generates the monthly invoice for clients and then charges $35 per invoice notifying the client,1
The Registry office selects the paper-based invoices that have been paid in order to archive the invoices per vendor and then per payment data also this office tracks down the payment,1
The process of buying new hardware is started as soon as a request for new hardware is received by the IT department,1
The next step is for the IT department to analyse the request and either approve or deny it,1
If it is denied the employee is informed via email about the denial and the process is ended,1
However if the request is approved it is edited and completed,1
Then an email is sent to the supplier asking about prices,1
Then the supplier replies to the email by sending an offer for the requested items,1
Once this offer is received a form is filled in and sent to the management,1
The management then analyses the request and decides if it is approved or not,1
In the former case the offer is forwarded to the financial department and back to the IT department,1
The financial department finds resources while the IT department prepares an order and sends this to the supplier,1
When this is accepted and the financial resources are found the hardware is received by the IT department,1
After which the financial department will take care of the invoice and the processes is ended,1
In the scenario where the management does not approve the request it can send the request back to the IT department for rework then the IT department has to go back to editing and completing a request,1
If the management does not approve the request it can also decide to deny the request after which the process is ended,1
The process starts with the Provision Team receiving a request from a Customer,1
First the team has to identify the necessary parts,1
If the team has any question about the request they may ask for more information to the customer,1
Afterwards the team needs to check if all parts are available,1
If available they are supplied to the customer,1
Otherwise the team must record the petition make an order to Daisuki and contact the customer once the team collects all parts,1
After the items are recollected by the customer the final payment is received,1
The reimbursement process within the ERICS company is started as soon as a reimbursement request is received,1
After receiving the request a reimbursement contact is created,1
Afterwards a beneficiary is chosen,1
Then a refund period is contract duration is determined,1
Once this has been completed a check is done to see if a customer is part of a Verband or only has normal subsidiaries,1
In the former case the customer group association is selected,1
In the latter case customers are selected manually,1
Once either of these two activities have been completed a threshold is set,1
Once the refund period has ended a credit note is printed and sent to the customer,1
In the meanwhile a reimbursement is calculated and paid to the customer,1
Once the payment has been made and the notification to the customer has been sent the process ends,1
The process starts by reviewing the order,1
The staff should check if all the requested items are available,1
If something is missing the staff has to inform customer about a potential delay and order the missing products,1
In the exceptional case of a discontinued item the customer should be informed about the not longer available items,1
After waiting an average of x days for the delivery the staff should check again if all products are on store,1
If everything is OK then the staff recollects all products and prepare a package,1
The courier is then informed about the pre-processed package,1
The courier company informs the client about a potential delay until there are enough human resources to process the delivery,1
Then the package is picked up by the designed driver,1
A centralized service decides the best route to deliver all drivers packages,1
Once the driver delivers the package she should update the system so all stakeholders are notified,1
The process starts with an informational meeting among the web design team,1
If this meeting is not successful the process ends here,1
Otherwise the team starts by creating a storyboard,1
After an agreement on the storyboard part of the team starts working on the design and development of the website,1
Simultaneously the team will start to prepare an initial draft of the content,1
In case a review of the draft is needed the marketing team will conduct this before the web design team creates the final version of the content,1
When the development and content have been completed the website will be built and reviewed,1
If the site is approved the process is completed otherwise the team goes back to the building step,1
After management indicates that new clients are needed the marketing team will perform a market analysis and prepare a portfolio presentation,1
When they have sent out offers to potential clients the marketing team informs management about the responses,1
Management then starts negotiations by sending out a detailed offer to the client,1
If the client accepts the offer management will prepare a contract that will be signed,1
Otherwise management analyzes the reason why their offer failed in order to improve in the future,1
An order to cash process starts when a customer order is received,1
After the order has been processed it is send to the warehouse,1
The warehouse employees determine the parts required to produce the requested items,1
If any parts are not available in the warehouse these are ordered,1
Once all necessary parts are available production will start,1
After production quality checks will be performed,1
If the production process has finished products will be packaged and labeled before returning to the warehouse,1
A client who wants to create a Paypal account first needs to determine the desired account type,1
He should either select a personal account or a premium account,1
Afterwards the client should enter login details Finally the client needs to declare if he has been affiliated with any politically exposed person,1
When the client clicks the create account button the details will be sent to the Paypal system,1
When a request is received the system will validate the input fields,1
If there are any invalid fields the client will be notified and needs to correct them,1
Otherwise a welcome email will be generated and sent to indicate that an account has been created,1
The process starts when the IS is notified about a data validation error,1
The drop-off tech checks for typos,1
If this is not the case the technician checks if the customer can correct the mistake,1
Otherwise public sources are scoured for solutions,1
As soon as any check was passed the issue is considered resolved,1
Once the Mail Centre office of SSP receives an invoice from the client it categorizes the invoice by staff member,1
Then the invoice is forwarded to the Administration Department this Department processes the Invoice (a complex process) and then puts all the invoices into a collection box,1
At 10 am every workday the Data Entry office takes the invoices and enters all data in the SAP system another complex process,1
Every hour the Mail Centre office reviews the system and forwards all new invoices for validation the Validation office executes the big process of validating invoices,1
At the beginning of every week the Payment office executes the payment of every validate invoice this is another big process,1
After the payment all invoices are archived by the Registry office,1
The process starts when the SO Angebot/Auftrag receives a subsidiary order,1
The SO Angebot/Auftrag prepare s goods for shipment and then ships the goods concurrently with preparing the goods and shipping them the SO Angebot/Auftrag prepares invoicing,1
In case the customer is subsidiary and the subsidiary relationship is not yet modeled SO Address- management adds parent company as invoicing address then the SO Angebot/Auftrag create the invoice,1
Otherwise if the customer is independent or the subsidiary relationship is already modeled in ERP the SO Angebot/Auftrag directly creates the invoice,1
Finally the SO Angebot/Auftrag sends the invoice,1
First the Vendor is tried to be located into the SAP system of the company,1
If it is not possible to find it a sub-process to record this new Vendor is started,1
The request for this new Vendor Record starts with the filling of the new Vendor Master Record form,1
After this the request is attached to the invoice and then putted in an internal outbox for new vendors,1
Before the request is finished it is classified in urgent and non-urgent invoices,1
Whenever the Invoice is urgent this Request has a maximum 24 hr window to be finished while if it is non-urgent it has a 1-5 working days time to be done,1
If the Vendor is already in the system or the request for new Vendor Record has finished its SAP number is then added to the invoice and the process continues,1
The invoices are then entered in the SAP system and the process is finished,1
The process starts when the admin office in SSP receives the invoice the admin office then sorts the invoice per client sorts the invoice per vendor attaches invoice entry form to invoice enters required info on the invoice entry form and checks the completeness of the invoice after the client has completed the invoice,1

If the invoice has high priority the admin office applies the red stamp on entry invoice,1
Afterwards the admin office checks the invoice compliance,1
If the invoice is complete the admin office allocates invoice to DEO,1
Otherwise if the invoice is not complete the admin office can either send it to experience staff who should process the non-compliance invoice call the client and request for information or send a postal mail requesting the information complete in this case a reminder is sent to the client after 10 hours,1
Finally when the missing information are obtained the admin office can allocate invoice to DEO,1
The process starts with the business analyst collecting data and conducting business analysis regarding customer feedback then the web designer integrates the design and decides where the customer feedback module should be placed,1
The business analyst waits until the design is complete then she checks the design and provides feedback,1
If the design needs adjustment the web designer has to change the design and integrates the design and decides where the customer feedback module should be placed again,1
If the design is OK,1
The PHP/HTML/CSS specialist integrates with the overall implementation and then the tester tests the final website to make sure everything is going well,1
If the test is OK the process ends otherwise if the test is not ok the tester provides test results to the PHP/HTML/CSS specialist who adjusts according to the test results and integrates the overall implementation again,1
In the process of adding a credit card for an internet purchase after choosing to pay with credit card the user has to put his credit card details after that the billing address is checked,1

The Credit Card is then verified by the Credit Card Authority,1
The result is then checked and if it is validated the credit card is added if not the addition is cancelled,1
The process starts with a visitor filling out a registration-form,1
The availability of products and the credit rating is checked first,1
If the credit rating is higher than 9000 (according to Schufa) the registration is called unsuccessful,1
If not the interim customer dataset record is created,1
After this two sub-processes starts in parallel Device provision and Register customer account at ISP nodes,1

A PayPal client wants to pay with bank account and has selected this as payment option,1
For bank account addition first the PayPal client needs to enter all 1 bank details i.e. first name bank name account type BSB and account number and click continue,1
This submits the bank details to the PayPal system,1
After the bank details are submitted to the PayPal system it makes two random deposits in the bank account,1
The PayPal system sends a message with this information to the client bank account,1
By this the two deposits to the bank account are made,1
Then after 3-5 working days it notifies the PayPal client to check his bank account for received deposits,1
The client may now log into his PayPal account enter the amounts from the two deposits and click verify,1
The PayPal system then checks its values against the values entered by the client,1
If the values match the bank account is linked to the clients PayPal account and is considered as confirmed,1
If the values do not match the bank account is removed from the PayPal system i.e. it could not be confirmed,1
In the process of reward and training first the management checks the employee performance,1
If the performance is less than 20% the management suggests the employee’s dismissal to the human resources department (HR),1
Then the HR dismisses the employee,1
If the employee performance is greater than 20% but less than 50% the management will suggest training which in turn is provided by HR,1
If the performance exceeds 75% the management suggests the employee for reward,1
Regarding the latter the management chooses an appropriate benefit,1
The financial reward is calculated and payed by the finance departement,1
Finally the management announces the rewarded employee as employee of the month,1
A purchase is initiated by a demand identified within a department,1
If there are enough goods in stock to satisfy this demand then they are consumed locally and no further action is required,1
Otherwise the department defines which type of goods are needed and the necessary amounts and a purchase requisition is created in the ERP system,1
This purchase requisition is processed by the Central procurement department,1
First the purchase requisition is checked on the ERP system to see whether the supplier information is available,1
If this is a new supplier first it has to be created within the ERP system,1
Once it is created (or it if was already a known supplier) the purchase requisition is used to create an order template in the ERP system,1
After receiving the new order template from the ERP system he approves and triggers the purchase order,1
In ACME Inc. the process of purchase order-to-delivery is started by the financial department,1

Whenever the sales department receives an order a new process instance is created,1
A member of the sales department can then reject or accept the order for a customized bike,1
In the former case the process instance is finished,1
In the latter case the storehouse and the engineering department are informed,1
The storehouse immediately processes the part list of the order and checks the required quantity of each part,1
If the part is available in-house it is reserved,1
If it is not available it is back-ordered,1
This procedure is repeated for each item on the part list,1
In the meantime the engineering department prepares everything for the assembling of the ordered bicycle,1
If the storehouse has successfully reserved or back-ordered every item of the part list and the preparation activity has finished the engineering department assembles the bicycle,1
Afterwards the sales department ships the bicycle to the customer and finishes the process instance,1
The Police Report related to the car accident is searched within the Police Report database and put in a file together with the Claim Documentation,1
This file serves as input to a claims handler who calculates an initial claim estimate,1
Then the claims handler creates an Action Plan based on an Action Plan Checklist available in the Document Management system,1
Based on the Action Plan a claims manager tries to negotiate a settlement on the claim estimate,1
The claimant is informed of the outcome which ends the process,1
If goods shall be shipped the secretary clarifies who will do the shipping,1
If you have large amounts special shipping will be necessary,1
In these cases the secretary invites three logistic companies to make offers and she selects one of them,1
In case of small amounts normal post shipment is used,1
Therefore a package label is written by the secretary and a parcel insurance taken by the logistics department head if necessary,1
In the meantime the goods can be already packaged by the warehousemen,1
If everything is ready the packaged goods are prepared for being picked up by the logistic company,1
The process starts when the female patient is examined by an outpatient physician who decides whether she is healthy or needs to undertake an additional examination,1
In the former case the physician fills out the examination form and the patient can leave,1
In the latter case an examination and follow-up treatment order is placed by the physician who additionally fills out a request form,1
Furthermore the outpatient physician informs the patient about potential risks,1
If the patient signs an informed consent and agrees to continue with the procedure a delegate of the physician arranges an appointment of the patient with one of the wards,1
The latter is then responsible for taking a sample to be analysed in the lab later,1
Before the appointment the required examination and sampling is prepared by a nurse of the ward based on the information provided by the outpatient section,1
Then a ward physician takes the sample requested,1
He further sends it to the lab indicated in the request form and conducts the follow-up treatment of the patient,1
After receiving the sample a physician of the lab validates its state and decides whether the sample can be used for analysis or whether it is contaminated and a new sample is required,1
After the analysis is performed by a medical technical assistant of the lab a lab physician validates the results,1
Finally a physician from the outpatient department makes the diagnosis and prescribes the therapy for the patient,1

If the claim is OK the claim handling process proceeds,1
The claimant is expected to return the questionnaire within five days,1
If no response is received after five days a reminder is sent to the claimant,1
If after another five days there is still no response another reminder is sent and so on until the completed questionnaire is received,1
Within this unit the Mail Clerk sorts the unopened mail into the various business areas,1
The mail is then distributed,1
When the mail is received by the Registry it is opened and sorted into groups for distribution and thus registered in a manual incoming Mail Register,1
Afterwards the Assistant Registry Manager within the Registry performs a quality check,1
If the mail is not compliant a list of requisition explaining the reason for rejection is compiled and sent back to the party,1
Otherwise the matter details (types of action) are captured and provided to the Cashier who takes the applicable fees attached to the mail,1
At this point the Assistant Registry Manager puts the receipt and copied documents into an envelope and posts it to the party,1

Whenever a company makes the decision to go public its first task is to select the underwriters,1
Thus in addition to handling the sale of a company’s issue the underwriters in effect give their seal of approval to it,1
They prepare a registration statement for the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),1
In addition to registering the issue with the SEC they need to check that the issue complies with the so-called blue-sky laws of each state that regulate sales of securities within the state,1
While the registration statement is awaiting approval underwriters begin to firm up the issue price,1
They arrange a road show to talk to potential investors,1
Immediately after they receive clearance from the SEC underwriters fix the issue price,1
After that they enter into a firm commitment to buy the stock and then offer it to the public when they haven’t still found any reason not to do it,1
First of all the customer must decide whether he wants an individual or family membership,1

The process starts when a client cannot find a product at a local shop of HomeDeco,1
Client requests to a clerk if the product is available at the local warehouse,1
The clerk checks the availability of the product with the ERP system of HomeDeco,1
If the product is available at the local warehouse the clerk makes a request to a warehouse manager to deliver the product to client at clerk’s desk directly,1
If the product is not available the clerk asks client if he would like to order that product or not,1
The product is normally delivered within 5 days at the local shop,1
If client refuses the request the process ends,1
Otherwise the clerk makes an order for him,1
When the clerk finishes the order he prints the order and invoice for client so that he can use for picking up the product when it is delivered and paying at checkout respectively,1
If the payment is not received within two days the order is cancelled and a notification message is sent to client,1
When the payment is received the order is sent to the central warehouse and a message is sent to inform client that the product will be delivered within 5 days,1
When the product is delivered at the local shop an sms is sent to inform client the availability of the product at the local shop and he can pick up the product at any time and the process is terminated,1
If the product is not delivered within 5 days a notification is sent to client by asking him if he either maintains or cancels the order,1
If client wishes to cancel the order HomeDeco reimburses client directly to his bank account and the process ends,1
Otherwise a coupon of 20% of reduction for next purchase is offered to client and it is sent by email,1

The process starts when a Travel Agency received a flight reservation request from a client by email or phone,1
Travel Agency searches and evaluates flights based on client’s travel preferences (travel dates airport),1
Then Travel Agency sends the most interesting flights to client (including itinerary price) and waits for the answer,1
After 24 hours if the answer is not received a reminder is sent and client has another 24 hours to answer,1
If no answer is received the request is cancelled and Travel Agency notifies client,1
Client rejects all the proposed flights or accepts one of the proposed flights or changes travel preferences,1
For the latter the process restarts it is considered as a new request,1
In case of a flight is chosen Travel Agency requests client’s personal information such as first name last name date of birth number of passport ,1
so that Travel Agency can make a booking with airline company and it is valid for 7 days,1
If there is no answer from client regarding the personal information within 48 hours the request is cancelled and Travel Agency notifies client,1
After the booking is done Travel Agency sends flight information and a link to proceed the payment online to client,1
One day before the expiration date Travel Agency sends a reminder to client if payment is not received,1
When the payment is received Travail Agency completes the booking with airline company and notifies client by sending an e-Ticket,1

A small company manufactures customized bicycles,0
The examination process can be summarised as follows,0
Beyond information about the patient the request form includes details about the examination requested and refers to a suitable lab,0
The Evanstonian is an upscale independent hotel,0
Eighty percent of room-service orders include wine or some other alcoholic beverage (i.e. puts a tablecloth on the cart and gathers silverware),0
The waiter may wait to do the billing if he has another order to prepare or deliver,0
The ongoing repair consists of two activities which are executed in an arbitrary order,0
In the context of a claim handling process it is sometimes necessary to send a questionnaire to the claimant to gather additional information,0
Underwriters act as financial midwives to a new issue,0
Usually they play a triple role First they provide the company with procedural and financial advice then they buy the issue and finally they resell it to the public,0
Established underwriters are careful of their reputation and will not handle a new issue unless they believe the facts have been presented fairly,0
When a visitor wants to become a member of Barcelonas ZooClub the following steps must be taken,0
Such as e-mail address and desired password personal details such as name and date of birth as well as his telephone number and address,0
The invoices can be sorted in two ways by amount and by vendor,0
This process describes how purchases work at the ACME Inc company,0
The final step in the process is the approval of this order which is granted by another role called approver,0
The account creation process at this bank proceeds as follows,0
As a basic principle ACME AG receives invoices on paper or fax,0
For instance a sales person on a trip rents a car,0
Since the company has expense rules there are circumstances where the supervisor can accept or reject the report upon first inspection,0
These rules could be automated to reduce the workload on the supervisor - for example to correct errors or better describe an expense including e.g. payment or refund and accounting,0
Unfortunately it is not coupled correctly to our Enterprise Resource Planning system (ERP),0
By the way that is the second step,0
This notice is done by the family doctor of somebody who is in need of mental treatment,0
The registration form as well as the print from the information system are stored in the patient file,0
Each patient will be assigned to a social-medical worker who will act as the first intaker of the patient,0
One of the physicians will act as the second intaker,0
(this process will not be detailed here),0
(i.e. contract commitment data + prioritized actions),0
(based on the received data),0
Three alternative process paths may be taken,0
Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution,0
The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times,0
This object consists of data elements such as the customer’s name and address and the assigned power gauge (including data such as bank connection information on the selected rate requested date of switch-over),0
I.e. the contract documents are not (or incorrectly) generated (i,0
the customer service (of the “new” supplier) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination),0
(i.e. no supplier concurrence),0
An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days,0
The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary (as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way) but it can speed up the switch process,0
The first step is to determine contact details of potential customers,0
This can be achieved in several ways,0
It is given either by a sales representative or by a pre-sales employee in case of a more technical presentation,0
To make an order a client must exist in the ERP system of HomeDeco,0
In addition HomeDeco allows payment online also,0
