The party sends a warrant possession request asking a warrant to be released,Relevant
The Client Service Back Office as part of the Small Claims Registry Operations receives the request and retrieves the SCT file,Relevant
Then  the SCT Warrant Possession is forwarded to Queensland Police,Relevant
The SCT physical file is stored by the Back Office awaiting a report to be sent by the Police,Relevant
When the report is received  the respective SCT file is retrieved,Relevant
Then  Back Office attaches the new SCT document  and stores the expanded SCT physical file,Relevant
After that  some other MC internal staff receives the physical SCT file  out of scope ,Relevant
As a basic principle  ACME AG receives invoices on paper or fax,Irrelevant
These are received by the Secretariat in the central inbox and forwarded after a short visual inspection to an accounting employee,Relevant
In ACME Financial Accounting  a software specially developed for the ACME AG  she identifies the charging suppliers and creates a new instance  invoice ,Relevant
She then checks the invoice items and notes the corresponding cost center at the ACME AG and the related cost center managers for each position on a separate form  docket ,Relevant
The docket and the copy of the invoice go to the internal mail together and are sent to the first cost center manager to the list,Relevant
He reviews the content for accuracy after receiving the copy of the invoice,Relevant
Should everything be in order  he notes his code one on the docket  accurate position - AP  and returns the copy of the invoice to the internal mail,Relevant
From it  the copy of the invoice is passed on to the next cost center manager  based on the docket  or if all items are marked correct  sent back to accounting,Relevant
Therefore  the copy of invoice and the docket gradually move through the hands of all cost center managers until all positions are marked as completely accurate,Relevant
However  if inconsistencies exist  e.g. because the ordered product is not of the expected quantity or quality  the cost center manager rejects the AP with a note and explanatory statement on the docket  and the copy of the invoice is sent back to accounting directly,Relevant
Based on the statements of the cost center managers  she will proceed with the clarification with the vendor  but  if necessary  she consults the cost center managers by telephone or e-mail again,Relevant
When all inconsistencies are resolved  the copy of the invoice is sent to the cost center managers again  and the process continues,Relevant
After all invoice items are AP  the accounting employee forwards the copy of the invoice to the commercial manager,Relevant
He makes the commercial audit and issues the approval for payment,Relevant
If the bill amount exceeds EUR 20 000  the Board wants to check it again  4-eyes-principle ,Relevant
The copy of the invoice including the docket moves back to the accounting employee in the appropriate signature file,Relevant
Should there be a complaint during the commercial audit  it will be resolved by the accounting employee with the supplier,Relevant
After the commercial audit is successfully completed  the accounting employee gives payment instructions and closes the instance in ACME financial accounting,Relevant
The loan approval process starts by receiving a customer request for a loan amount,Relevant
The risk assessment Web service is invoked to assess the request,Relevant
If the loan is small and the customer is low risk  the loan is approved,Relevant
If the customer is high risk  the loan is denied,Relevant
If the customer needs further review or the loan amount is for $10 000 or more  the request is sent to the approver Web service,Relevant
The customer receives feedback from the assessor or approver,Relevant
The process of Vacations Request starts when any employee of the organization submits a vacation request,Relevant
Once the requirement is registered  the request is received by the immediate supervisor of the employee requesting the vacation,Relevant
The supervisor must approve or reject the request,Relevant
If the request is rejected  the application is returned to the applicant/employee who can review the rejection reasons,Relevant
If the request is approved a notification is generated to the Human Resources Representative  who must complete the respective management procedures,Relevant
The process of Vacations Request starts when any employee of the organization submits a vacation request,Relevant
Once the requirement is registered  the request is received by the immediate supervisor of the employee requesting the vacation,Relevant
The supervisor must approve or reject the request,Relevant
If the request is rejected the process will end,Relevant
If the request is asked to make a change then it is returned to the petitioner/employee who can review the comments for the change request,Relevant
If the request is approved it will go to the purchase department that will be in charge of making quotations  using a subprocess  and select a vendor,Relevant
If the vendor is not valid in the system the purchase department will have to choose a different vendor,Relevant
After a vendor is selected and confirmed  the system will generate and send a purchase order and wait for the product to be delivered and the invoice received,Relevant
In any case the system will send a notification to let the user know what the result was,Relevant
In any of the cases  approval  rejection or change required the system will send the user a notification,Relevant
First  the Manager checks the open leads,Relevant
Afterwards  he selects the top five ones,Relevant
He then tells his Sales Assistant to call the contact person of the leads,Relevant
The Sales Assistant calls each customer,Relevant
If someone is interested  he sends a note to the Manager,Relevant
The Manager then processes the lead,Relevant
Otherwise  he calls the next customer,Relevant
The customer enters the withdrawal amount,Relevant
The ATM returns cash to the customer and changes his account balance,Relevant
If the balance on customer’s account is less than the withdrawal amount  the ATM returns an error,Relevant
In a bowl  mix the lemon juice  olive oil  Dijon mustard  garlic  red bell pepper  salt  and pepper,Relevant
Set aside 1/4 cup of the mixture to use for basting,Relevant
Place chicken in the bowl  and marinate at least 20 minutes in the refrigerator,Relevant
Preheat grill for high heat,Relevant
Lightly oil grill grate,Relevant
Drain and discard marinade from the bowl  and place chicken on the grill,Relevant
Cook 6 to 8 minutes on each side  until juices run clear  basting occasionally with the reserved marinade,Relevant
An employee purchases a product or service he requires,Relevant
For instance  a sales person on a trip rents a car,Irrelevant
The employee submits an expense report with a list of items  along with the receipts for each item,Relevant
A supervisor reviews the expense report and approves or rejects the report,Relevant
Since the company has expense rules  there are circumstances where the supervisor can accept or reject the report upon first inspection,Irrelevant
These rules could be automated  to reduce the workload on the supervisor,Irrelevant
If the supervisor rejects the report  the employee  who submitted it  is given a chance to edit it ,Relevant
for example to correct errors or better describe an expense,Irrelevant
If the supervisor approves the report  it goes to the treasurer,Relevant
The treasurer checks that all the receipts have been submitted and match the items on the list,Relevant
If all is in order  the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing,Relevant
 including  e.g. payment or refund  and accounting ,Irrelevant
If receipts are missing or do not match the report  he sends it back to the employee,Relevant
If a report returns to the employee for corrections  it must again go to a supervisor  even if the supervisor previously approved the report,Relevant
If the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing  the report moves to an automatic activity that links to a payment system,Relevant
The process waits for the payment confirmation,Relevant
After the payment is confirmed  the process ends,Relevant
Every time we get a new order from the sales department  first  one of my masters determines the necessary parts and quantities as well as the delivery date,Relevant
Once that information is present  it has to be entered into our production planning system  PPS ,Relevant
It optimizes our production processes and creates possibly uniform work packages so that the setup times are minimized,Relevant
Besides  it creates a list of parts to be procured,Relevant
Unfortunately it is not coupled correctly to our Enterprise Resource Planning system  ERP   so the data must be transferred manually,Irrelevant
By the way  that is the second step,Irrelevant
Once all the data is present  we need to decide whether any parts are missing and must be procured or if this is not necessary,Relevant
Once production is scheduled to start  we receive a notice from the system and an employee takes care of the implementation,Relevant
Finally  the order will be checked again for its quality,Relevant
The intake workflow starts with a notice by telephone at the secretarial office of the mental health care institute,Relevant
This notice is done by the family doctor of somebody who is in need of mental treatment,Irrelevant
The secretarial worker inquires after the name and residence of the patient,Relevant
On the basis of this information  the doctor is put through to the nursing officer responsible for the part of the region that the patient lives in,Relevant
The nursing officer makes a full inquiry into the mental  health  and social state of the patient in question,Relevant
This information is recorded on a registration form,Relevant
At the end of the conversation  this form is handed in at the secretarial office of the institute,Relevant
Here  the information on the form is stored in the information system and subsequently printed,Relevant
For new patients  a patient file is created,Relevant
The registration form as well as the print from the information system are stored in the patient file,Irrelevant
At the secretarial office  two registration cards are produced for respectively the future first and second intaker of the patient,Relevant
The new patient is added on the list of new notices,Relevant
Halfway the week  at Wednesday  a staff meeting of the entire medical team takes place,Relevant
At this meeting  the team-leader assigns all new patients on the list of new notices to members of the team,Relevant
Each patient will be assigned to a social-medical worker  who will act as the first intaker of the patient,Irrelevant
One of the physicians will act as the second intaker,Irrelevant
The assignments are recorded on an assignment list which is handed to the secretarial office,Relevant
For each new assignment  it is also determined whether the medical file of the patient is required,Relevant
This information is added to the assignment list,Relevant
The secretarial office stores the assignment of each patient of the assignment list in the information system,Relevant
It passes the produced registration cards to the first and second intaker of each newly assigned patient,Relevant
For each patient for which the medical file is required  the secretarial office prepares and sends a letter to the family doctor of the patient  requesting for a copy of the medical file,Relevant
As soon as this copy is received  the secretarial office will inform the second intaker and add the copy to the patient file,Relevant
The first intaker plans a meeting with the patient as soon as this is possible,Relevant
During the first meeting  the patient is examined using a standard checklist which is filled out,Relevant
Additional observations are registered in a personal notebook,Relevant
After a visit  the first intaker puts a copy of these notes in the file of a patient,Relevant
The standard checklist is also added to the patients file,Relevant
The second intaker plans the first meeting only after the medical information of the physician   if required   has been received,Relevant
Physicians use dictaphones to record their observations made during meetings with patients,Relevant
The secretarial office types out these tapes  after which the information is added to the patient file,Relevant
As soon as the meetings of the first and second intaker with the patient have taken place  the secretarial office puts the patient on the list of patients that reach this status,Relevant
For the staff meeting on Wednesday  they provide the team-leader with a list of these patients,Relevant
For each of these patients  the first and second intaker together with the team-leader and the attending psychiatrist formulate a treatment plan,Relevant
This treatment plan formally ends the intake procedure,Relevant
At the beginning the customer perceives that her subscribed service has degraded,Relevant
A list with all the problem parameters is then sent to the Customer Service department of TELECO,Relevant
At the customer service an employee enters,Relevant
 based on the received data ,Irrelevant
a problem report into system T,Relevant
Then the problem report is compared to the customer SLA to identify what the extent and the details of the service degradation are,Relevant
Based on this  the necessary counter measures are determined including their respective priorities,Relevant
An electronic service then determines the significance of the customer based on information that has been collected during the history of the contractual relationship,Relevant
In case the customer is premium  the process will link to an extra problem fix process,Relevant
 this process will not be detailed here ,Irrelevant
In case the customer is of certain significance which would affect the counter measures previously decided upon  the process goes back to re-prioritize these measures   otherwise the process continues,Relevant
Taking together the information,Relevant
 i.e. contract commitment data + prioritized actions ,Irrelevant
a detailed problem report is created,Relevant
The detailed problem report is then sent to Service Management,Relevant
Service Management deals on a first level with violations of quality in services that are provided to customers,Relevant
After receiving the detailed problem report  Service management investigates whether the problem is analyzable at the level of their department or whether the problem may be located at Resource Provisioning,Relevant
In case Service Management assesses the problem to be not analyzable by themselves  the detailed problem report is sent out to Resource Provisioning,Relevant
If Service Management is sure they can analyze it  they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem,Relevant
After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report  it is checked whether there are any possible problems,Relevant
If no problems are detected  a notification about the normal service execution is created,Relevant
If a problem is detected this will be analyzed by Resource Provisioning and a trouble report is created,Relevant
Either trouble report or the ‘normal execution’ notification will be included in a status report and sent back to Service Management,Relevant
Service Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information,Relevant
Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report,Relevant
Three alternative process paths may be taken,Irrelevant
For the case that no problem was detected at all  the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service,Relevant
For the case that minor corrective actions are required  Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves,Relevant
Subsequently  the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service,Relevant
After sending  this process path of Service Management ends,Relevant
For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required  Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration,Relevant
This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning,Relevant
Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request   but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out  otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process,Relevant
After the restoration request is received  all possible errors are tracked,Relevant
Based on the tracked errors  all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning,Relevant
Then a trouble-shooting report is created,Relevant
This report is sent out to Service Management  then the process ends,Relevant
The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii ,Relevant
Customer Service either receives the actual service performance  if there was no problem  or the problem resolution report,Relevant
Then  two concurrent activities are triggered  i.e.,Relevant
i  a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem ,Relevant
and ii  an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing,Relevant
The report for the customer is sent out to her,Relevant
After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service,Relevant
After the customer then receives the report about service performance and problem resolution from Customer Service  the process flow at the customer also ends,Relevant
The process is initiated by a switch-over request,Relevant
In doing so  the customer transmits his data to the customer service department of the company,Relevant
Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution,Irrelevant
The customer data is received by customer service and based on this data a customer data object is entered into the CRM system,Relevant
After customer data has been entered it should then be compared with the internal customer data base and checked for completeness and plausibility,Relevant
In case of any errors these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list,Relevant
The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times,Irrelevant
In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base  a new customer object is being created which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow,Relevant
This object consists of data elements such as the customer’s name and address and the assigned power gauge  including data such as bank connection  information on the selected rate  requested date of switch-over ,Irrelevant
The generated customer object is then used  in combination with other customer data to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch,Relevant
 including data such as bank connection  information on the selected rate  requested date of switch-over ,Irrelevant
In the following an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS  customer information system  in order to confirm their successful generation,Relevant
In case of a negative response ,Relevant
i.e. the contract documents are not  or incorrectly  generated,Irrelevant
  the causing issues are being analyzed and resolved,Relevant
Subsequently the contract documents are generated once again,Relevant
In case of a positive response a confirmation document is sent out to the customer stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed,Relevant
A request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the CIS,Relevant
It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future,Relevant
The switch-over request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence  and the grid operator transmits a response comment,Relevant
In the case of supplier concurrence  the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the resolution of the conflict,Relevant
The grid operator communicates with the old supplier and carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier,Relevant
 i.e. the customer service  of the new  supplier  does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination ,Irrelevant
If there are not any objections by the grid operator,Relevant
 i.e. no supplier concurrence ,Irrelevant
customer service creates a CIS contract,Relevant
The customer then has the chance to check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it,Relevant
Depending on the customer’s acceptance/rejection the process flow at customer service either ends  in case of withdrawal  or continues  in case of a confirmation ,Relevant
An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days   after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues,Relevant
The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary  as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way  but it can speed up the switch process,Irrelevant
On the switch-date  but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun  the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption report,Relevant
At the same time  the grid operator computes the final billing based on the meter data and sends it to the old supplier,Relevant
Likewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer,Relevant
For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then,Relevant
After receiving the meter data customer service imports the meter data to systems that require the information,Relevant
The process of winning  a new customer ends here,Relevant
The first step is to determine contact details of potential customers,Relevant
This can be achieved in several ways,Irrelevant
Sometimes  we buy details for cold calls  sometimes  our marketing staff participates in exhibitions and sometimes  you just happen to know somebody  who is interested in the product,Relevant
Then we start calling the customer,Relevant
That is done by the call center staff,Relevant
They are determining the contact person and the budget which would be available for the project,Relevant
Of course  asking the customer whether he is generally interested is also important,Relevant
If this is not the case  we leave him alone  except if the potential project budget is huge,Relevant
Then the head of development personally tries to acquire the customer,Relevant
If the customer is interested in the end  the next step is a detailed online presentation,Relevant
It is given either by a sales representative or by a pre-sales employee in case of a more technical presentation,Irrelevant
Afterwards we are waiting for the customer to come back to us,Relevant
If we are not contacted within 2 weeks  a sales representative is calling the customer,Relevant
The last phase is the creation of a quotation,Relevant
The credit company receives the credit information from the customer  If the requested amount is greater than 1M$ an approval must be requested,Relevant
If the requested amount is lower or equal to 1M$ the company assess the risk of the credit,Relevant
After the assessment  if the risk is high  an approval must be requested  but if the risk is low the credit is accepted,Relevant
After the approval request  the credit could be accepted or rejected  in both cases  an email is sent to the customer,Relevant
The credit company collects the credit information from the customer  If the requested amount is greater than 1M$ an approval must be requested,Relevant
If the requested amount is lower or equal to 1M$ the company assess the risk of the credit,Relevant
After the assessment  if the risk is high  an approval must be requested  but if the risk is low the credit is accepted,Relevant
After the approval request  the credit could be accepted or rejected  in both cases  an email is sent to the customer,Relevant
The credit company collects the credit information from the customer  If the requested amount is lower or equal to 1M$ the company assess the risk of the credit,Relevant
After the assessment  if the risk is low the credit is accepted,Relevant
If the requested amount is greater than 1M$ or the risk of the credit is high  an approval must be requested,Relevant
After the approval request  the credit could be accepted or rejected  in both cases  an email is sent to the customer,Relevant
If a not collected bag is identified  CVS must check the number of resolution retries conducted,Relevant
If the number of retries is greater than an specified number  the bag must be returned to the production area for disassemble  in all other cases  CVS must try to contact the customer by phone and remind to pick up the bag,Relevant
If the contact is successful and the customer withdrawn the order  the bag must be returned to the production area for disassemble  but if it is successful and the customer promises to pick up the bag  CVS must increase the retry count on the bag label,Relevant
Also  this number must be increased if the contact is unsuccessful,Relevant
As soon as an employee files an expense report the process is started,Relevant
The process starts by reviewing the order,Relevant
The staff should check if all the requested items are available,Relevant
If something is missing  the staff has to inform customer about a potential delay and order the missing products,Relevant
In the exceptional case of a discontinued item  the customer should be informed about the not longer available items,Relevant
After waiting an average of x days for the delivery  the staff should check again if all products are on store,Relevant
If everything is OK  then the staff recollects all products and prepare a package,Relevant
The courier is then informed about the pre-processed package,Relevant
The courier company informs the client about a potential delay until there are enough human resources to process the delivery,Relevant
Then  the package is picked up by the designed driver,Relevant
A centralized service decides the best route to deliver all drivers packages,Relevant
Once the driver delivers the package  she should update the system so all stakeholders are notified,Relevant
The process starts with an informational meeting among the web design team,Relevant
If this meeting is not successful  the process ends here,Relevant
Otherwise  the team starts by creating a storyboard,Relevant
After an agreement on the storyboard  part of the team starts working on the design and development of the website,Relevant
Simultaneously  the team will start to prepare an initial draft of the content,Relevant
In case a review of the draft is needed  the marketing team will conduct this  before the web design team creates the final version of the content,Relevant
When the development and content have been completed  the website will be built and reviewed,Relevant
If the site is approved  the process is completed  otherwise the team goes back to the building step,Relevant
After management indicates that new clients are needed  the marketing team will perform a market analysis and prepare a portfolio presentation,Relevant
When they have sent out offers to potential clients the marketing team informs management about the responses,Relevant
Management then starts negotiations by sending out a detailed offer to the client,Relevant
If the client accepts the offer  management will prepare a contract that will be signed,Relevant
Otherwise  management analyzes the reason why their offer failed in order to improve in the future,Relevant
An order to cash process starts when a customer order is received,Relevant
After the order has been processed  it is send to the warehouse,Relevant
The warehouse employees determine the parts required to produce the requested items,Relevant
If any parts are not available in the warehouse  these are ordered,Relevant
Once all necessary parts are available  production will start,Relevant
After production  quality checks will be performed,Relevant
If the production process has finished  products will be packaged and labeled  before returning to the warehouse,Relevant
Finally  sales will be informed about the completed production and the product can be sold to the customer,Relevant
A client who wants to create a Paypal account first needs to determine the desired account type,Relevant
He should either select a personal account or a premium account,Relevant
Afterwards  the client should enter login details,Relevant
such as e-mail address and desired password  personal details  such as name and date of birth  as well as his telephone number and address,Irrelevant
Finally  the client needs to declare if he has been affiliated with any politically exposed person,Relevant
When the client clicks the create account button  the details will be sent to the Paypal system,Relevant
When a request is received  the system will validate the input fields,Relevant
If there are any invalid fields  the client will be notified and needs to correct them,Relevant
Otherwise a welcome email will be generated and sent to indicate that an account has been created,Relevant
The process starts when the IS is notified about a data validation error,Relevant
The drop-off tech checks for typos,Relevant
If this is not the case  the technician checks if the customer can correct the mistake,Relevant
Otherwise  public sources are scoured for solutions,Relevant
As soon as any check was passed  the issue is considered resolved,Relevant
Once the Mail Centre office of SSP receives an invoice from the client  it categorizes the invoice by staff member,Relevant
Then  the invoice is forwarded to the Administration Department  this Department processes the Invoice  a complex process  and then puts all the invoices into a collection box,Relevant
At 10 am every workday  the Data Entry office takes the invoices and enters all data in the SAP system  another complex process,Relevant
Every hour the Mail Centre office reviews the system and forwards all new invoices for validation  the Validation office executes the big process of validating invoices,Relevant
At the beginning of every week  the Payment office executes the payment of every validate invoice  this is another big process,Relevant
After the payment  all invoices are archived by the Registry office,Relevant
The process starts when the SO: Angebot/Auftrag receives a subsidiary order,Relevant
The SO: Angebot/Auftrag prepares goods for shipment and then ships the goods  concurrently with preparing the goods and shipping them  the SO: Angebot/Auftrag prepares invoicing,Relevant
In case the customer is subsidiary and the subsidiary relationship is not yet modeled  SO: Address- management adds parent company as invoicing address  then the SO: Angebot/Auftrag create the invoice,Relevant
Otherwise if the customer is independent or the subsidiary relationship is already modeled in ERP  the SO: Angebot/Auftrag directly creates the invoice,Relevant
Finally  the SO: Angebot/Auftrag sends the invoice,Relevant
In a certain company an Invoice process is started,Irrelevant
First the Vendor is tried to be located into the SAP system of the company,Relevant
If it is not possible to find it a sub-process to record this new Vendor is started,Relevant
The request for this new Vendor Record starts with the filling of the new Vendor Master Record form,Relevant
After this  the request is attached to the invoice and then putted in an internal outbox for new vendors,Relevant
Before the request is finished it is classified in urgent and non-urgent invoices,Relevant
Whenever the Invoice is urgent this Request has a maximum 24 hr window to be finished  while if it is non-urgent it has a 1-5 working days time to be done,Relevant
If the Vendor is already in the system or the request for new Vendor Record has finished  its SAP number is then added to the invoice and the process continues,Relevant
The invoices can be sorted in two ways: by amount and by vendor,Irrelevant
The invoices are then entered in the SAP system and the process is finished,Relevant
The process starts when the admin office in SSP receives the invoice  the admin office then sorts the invoice per client  sorts the invoice per vendor  attaches invoice entry form to invoice  enters required info on the invoice entry form  and checks the completeness of the invoice after the client has completed the invoice,Relevant
If the invoice is not completed a message is sent and the process finishes,Relevant
Otherwise  if the invoice is complete  the admin office enters the info for the SLA and checks the priority,Relevant
If the invoice has high priority  the admin office applies the red stamp on entry invoice,Relevant
Afterwards  the admin office checks the invoice compliance,Relevant
If the invoice is complete the admin office allocates invoice to DEO,Relevant
Otherwise  if the invoice is not complete  the admin office can either send it to experience staff who should process the non-compliance invoice  call the client and request for information  or send a postal mail requesting the information complete  in this case a reminder is sent to the client after 10 hours,Relevant
Finally  when the missing information are obtained the admin office can allocate invoice to DEO,Relevant
The process starts with the business analyst collecting data and conducting business analysis regarding customer feedback  then the web designer integrates the design and decides where the customer feedback module should be placed,Relevant
The business analyst waits until the design is complete  then she checks the design and provides feedback,Relevant
If the design needs adjustment the web designer has to change the design and integrates the design and decides where the customer feedback module should be placed  again,Relevant
If the design is OK,Relevant
The PHP/HTML/CSS specialist integrates with the overall implementation  and then the tester tests the final website to make sure everything is going well,Relevant
If the test is OK  the process ends  otherwise if the test is not ok the tester provides test results to the PHP/HTML/CSS specialist who adjusts according to the test results  and integrates the overall implementation  again,Relevant
In the process of adding a credit card for an internet purchase after choosing to pay with credit card the user has to put his credit card details  after that the billing address is checked,Relevant
If it is incorrect the process goes back to the user so that it can be modified  if it is correct the process continues,Relevant
Afterwards the user needs to click in the continue button to move forward,Relevant
The Credit Card is then verified by the Credit Card Authority,Relevant
The result is then checked and if it is validated the credit card is added  if not the addition is cancelled,Relevant
The process starts with a visitor filling out a registration-form,Relevant
The availability of products and the credit rating is checked first,Relevant
If the credit rating is higher than 9000  according to Schufa  the registration is called unsuccessful,Relevant
If not the interim customer dataset record is created,Relevant
After this two sub-processes starts in parallel: Device provision and Register customer account at ISP nodes,Relevant
Once these sub-processes are finished a welcome package is created and sent to the customer to alert them that the registration process was completed successfully,Relevant
A PayPal client wants to pay with bank account and has selected this as payment option,Relevant
For bank account addition  first  the PayPal client needs to enter all relevant bank details ,Relevant
i.e. first name  bank name  account type  BSB and account number ,Irrelevant
and click continue,Relevant
This submits the bank details to the PayPal system,Relevant
After the bank details are submitted to the PayPal system  it makes two random deposits in the bank account,Relevant
The PayPal system sends a message with this information to the client bank account,Relevant
By this  the two deposits to the bank account are made,Relevant
Then  after 3-5 working days it notifies the PayPal client to check his bank account for received deposits,Relevant
The client may now log into his PayPal account  enter the amounts from the two deposits and click verify,Relevant
The PayPal system then checks its values against the values entered by the client,Relevant
If the values match  the bank account is linked to the clients PayPal account and is considered as confirmed,Relevant
If the values do not match  the bank account is removed from the PayPal system  i.e. it could not be confirmed,Relevant
In the process of reward and training  first  the management checks the employee performance,Relevant
If the performance is less than 20   the management suggests the employee’s dismissal to the human resources department  HR ,Relevant
Then  the HR dismisses the employee,Relevant
If the employee performance is greater than 20  but less than 50   the management will suggest training  which in turn is provided by HR,Relevant
If the performance exceeds 75   the management suggests the employee for reward,Relevant
