The process starts when the need is notified by the receipt of a purchase order form by the service manager,Relevant
Then  the purchase department has to analyse the demand  if it is not ok  the demand is obviously rejected and the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise  they have to request a quote,Relevant
If the quote is asked to a new supplier  the purchasing department has to add it into the evaluation suppliers form  data base ,Relevant
Then  the financial management has to validate the quote  if it is not ok  the demand has to be analysed again but if it is financially ok  the service can be ordered so the service department asks for an intervention,Relevant
The supplier performs the requested service and sends the purchase documents  purchase order and invoice  afterwards,Relevant
Next  the purchasing department compares the purchase order with the invoice received and has to validate  if something is wrong  the invoice is not validated and the department contacts the supplier for another validation,Relevant
Otherwise  the financial department has to validate it a second time,Relevant
Again  if it is not ok  the purchase department has to compare it again but if it is ok  the financial department puts the invoice in payment and the process ends when the service provider is paid,Relevant
The process starts with the presentation of the candidate at the office,Relevant
He enrolls for the examination,Relevant
The centre manager checks the planning in the license database if the candidate is already planned,Relevant
If it is not the case  the centre has to create a new file for this candidate in the license database,Relevant
Then  he registers the candidate to the examination,Relevant
The applicant has to pay for his registration,Relevant
If the payment is not received  the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise  the process continues and the centre manager checks the validity of the candidate and guide s ID cards,Relevant
If those are invalid  the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
If  on the contrary  the ID cards are acceptable  the centre manager checks the age conditions,Relevant
If those are not fulfilled  the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise  the process continues and the centre checks that the ID card corresponds to the candidate,Relevant
If he notices a mismatch  the Chief examiner seizes his ID card and warns the authorities,Relevant
The candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
If it corresponds  the centre checks the temporary driving license and the certificate from the municipality,Relevant
If those are invalid  the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
If those are valid  there are 2 possibilities,Relevant
Either the applicant has learned by a driving school or by another guide,Relevant
This second case requires an additional step  the centre checks the guide driving license,Relevant
If his driving license is invalid  the process ends and the candidate is rejected,Relevant
If it is valid  the process keeps going,Relevant
This step is not necessary if the candidate has learnt by a driving school,Relevant
Next  the centre checks the vehicle documents,Relevant
If those are not valid  the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise  the process continues with the examiner who checks the vehicle state,Relevant
If he evaluates the car as defective  the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
On the contrary  if the vehicle is in good conditions  the centre manager makes a random selection of the examination track thanks to the IT system of the company and the candidate is allowed to take the examination,Relevant
The candidate is accepted and the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when the candidate arrives at the centre,Relevant
An employee of the centre completes the identity verification form at least every 25 candidates and checks the validity of the client s ID card  according to the regulation ,Relevant
If the ID card is not valid  the process ends and the client is refused,Relevant
If it is valid  the client s age is checked  once again according to the legislation,Relevant
If the candidate doesn t fulfil the age requirement  the process ends and he is refused,Relevant
In the case where the client fulfils the age requirement  the centre employee checks that the card corresponds to the candidate,Relevant
If the card is not corresponding to the candidate  the employee takes the ID card  warns the authorities and the process ends,Relevant
The client is thus refused because of failure and fraud,Relevant
If the card corresponds to the candidate  the centre employee checks the number of failures and the driving school certificate if necessary,Relevant
The employee then registers the candidate,Relevant
If a session is not available  the client asks the availability and or takes an appointment  then comes back to the beginning  arrival ,Relevant
If a session is available  he checks that the client is already in the database,Relevant
If the client isn t  the centre employee creates a new file in the Database Permis  ‘DB Permis  ,Relevant
If the client was already registered or has just been registered  the employee registers the candidates and checks his data,Relevant
After that the client has paid  the employee generates a session for the candidate  according to his category  from the ‘DB Permis  which generates a random series of questions,Relevant
The client takes the exam,Relevant
If a fraud is detected during the exam  the centre interrupts the exam and warns the authorities  the client is then refused  failure and fraud  and the process ends,Relevant
In each case  the results are printed by the centre,Relevant
If the exam is passed  the client takes the reading test  and the process ends with the delivery of the provisional driving licence  PCP   the results and some information,Relevant
If the exam is failed  the client is given the results of the exam,Relevant
The process starts when the candidate arrives at the examination centre,Relevant
There is a previous control of the vehicle by the examinator before he makes a random selection for the track with the IT system,Relevant
Then he takes note of the track and manoeuvres,Relevant
The customer makes the track and manoeuvres directed by the examinator  according to the traffic regulations ,Relevant
The examinator assesses the abilities of the candidate,Relevant
If he makes a dangerous manoeuvre  the exam is interrupted,Relevant
Otherwise the examinator makes a global assessment of the exam and he registers the assessments with the IT system,Relevant
He encodes the results and sends them to the server of the company  with the IT system and the protocol of the exam ,Relevant
Then he archives the protocol and at the same time  he gives the result to the candidate,Relevant
If the result is a success  the exam is passed but if it is a failure  the exam is failed,Relevant
The first step in the registration process is the quote calculation,Irrelevant
It begins when someone needs to obtain a tenant insurance,Relevant
The user will then take an interest in Flora and go to the website,Relevant
The customer will go on  découvrir mon prix  and so the quote calculation process begins,Relevant
The user is now on the page where he selects the type of housing,Relevant
It can be a house  2 or 3 faces   a villa  4 faces  or a flat,Irrelevant
Selecting an accommodation type enables the user to move forward to the next screen,Relevant
The user just has to click on the right button to go further  there is no  continue  button ,Relevant
Then the user has to enter his address to go further in the process,Relevant
When the user starts typing his address  a drop down list appears with all the street names corresponding to the entered characters,Relevant
In order to move forward  the user has to select one address in the Google results and the system moves on directly to the next page,Relevant
If the user enters an address abroad  the pop up window appears informing the user that Flora is only available in Belgium,Relevant
If the user lives in a zone subject to flooding  a pop up window also appears to say that the house is located in a zone subject to flooding and that the user cannot be insured for the moment  the user can be redirected to the Ethias website,Relevant
If the address is unknow   the message   Je ne trouve pas mon adresse   appears,Relevant
The user is redirected to the page where he has to enter manually his address  he has to complete manually all the fields,Relevant
If the address is known  located in Belgium and complete  the user clicks on  Confirmer  and is then redirected to the monthly rental amount page,Relevant
The monthly rental amount is a mandatory field,Irrelevant
If it is left empty  a warning red notice must ask the user to correctly fill it out  Max of characters  7 ,Relevant
If the user enters a higher rent  the pop up window appears informing the user that Flora doesn t insure properties with a rent higher than 1500€,Relevant
The user can decide to move on to the Ethias website or exit the Flora s quote calculation process by clicking on the X in the upper right hand corner   the button  Je comprends ,Relevant
The user then goes to the  Prix  page  which mentions the price of the rental insurance for his property at his address,Relevant
The price covers the civil liability and the content of the housing,Irrelevant
The user can choose to add or not add the vandalism cover,Relevant
To finish this process  the user has to tick the Checkbox of the terms conditions before being able to continue,Relevant
Once the quote calculation process is complete  a customer profile must be created,Irrelevant
This process starts with the screen  mon compte    the user must fill in different information  First name  name  date of birth  phone number  email address and password are mandatory fields,Relevant
Before going to the next step  the system makes a verification about the age of the user,Relevant
In fact  the user must be between eighteen and hundred years old because they consider that outside this age slice  you are less likely to take out insurance,Irrelevant
So  if the customer is under eighteen or over hundred  the process stops  and the customer gets stuck,Relevant
The next step consists in checking if the email address still exists in the system because it is possible to have a user who has given the account creation just after entering the personal information  or who has left the process for a moment perhaps to pick up where he left off later on,Relevant
So  if the email address did not still exist  Flora will then send an email to the user in order to allow him to validate his email address,Relevant
In the email  the user can push on a button  Valider mon compte  or on another  Je n ai pas demandé de compte Flora ,Relevant
If the email address still existed  we can go on the next step,Relevant
After that  Flora has to check if the email address is still validated,Relevant
If it is the case  the account is created and it s the final event,Relevant
If the user did not confirm his email address and pushed on button  Je n ai pas demandé de compte Flora   the process stops  and no account will be created for the user,Relevant
Just in order to precise a little  at the end of this business process  the user is still not a customer  he is a prospect,Irrelevant
He will become a customer once he will be logged into the application as such,Irrelevant
This step of the process is important because it will be impossible for the user to use the app as long as he is not a real client,Irrelevant
Indeed  he will be considered as a prospective customer until the moment he makes the payment,Irrelevant
Without this payment  even if the user created an account  he is not allowed to gain access to the application,Irrelevant
The first stage consists in asking the client information about his moving in the housing,Relevant
On the one hand  if he already moved in  Flora will invite the client to state if he is insured for this housing or not,Relevant
In case of a client who is already insured  Flora will ask the user to enter the contact details of his previous insurer and we will deal with the termination of his contract,Relevant
On the other hand  if the user has not moved in yet  the app will request him to enter the date of moving in and his future address,Relevant
After that  he will be invited to choose a payment method,Relevant
The client will soon be allowed to choose among three different means of payment   with a credit card  via PayPal or via Apple Pay,Relevant
For the moment  there are only two payment methods available   the credit card and PayPal,Irrelevant
By selecting the credit card as mean of payment  the user will be redirected to the next screen,Relevant
At that point  he will have to encode his card number  the name of the card  the validity date and the CVV number,Relevant
Obviously  there will be no direct debit before the start of the contract,Irrelevant
In the case where the user would want to pay with PayPal  he would be redirected to the PayPal interface in order to check that the available balance on PayPal is sufficient to pay,Relevant
Then  the user can click on the button  Suivant  which will redirect him to another screen with a summary of his contract   type of housing  monthly rental amount  full address  contract duration  price  credit card registered and so on,Relevant
After having checked the elements of his contract  he must accept the general terms conditions before subscribing to the product and paying,Relevant
Then  he can click on  Confirmer  and in that case  it means that the user wants to confirm and pay,Relevant
Once the contract is confirmed  the client will be invited to download the application in order to handle his insurance directly from the application,Relevant
From the moment he confirmed  the contract is forward to him by email,Relevant
Finally  at this step of the process  the client receives a confirmation email with the documents related to the contract attached,Relevant
If he receives this email  it means that the payment is accepted and therefore  the contract is confirmed,Relevant
From a legal point of view  it is mandatory to send a confirmation email to the policyholder,Irrelevant
From that moment  the client can log in into his account  access his profile and his documents  ask questions  manage decisions and request a refund in the event of a damage,Irrelevant
First of all  when the client wants to create a new claim  he needs to open the chat bot in the app,Relevant
The date of the damage will be requested from the customer to verify if he was covered by insurance at the time of the damage,Relevant
If this is not the case  the client will not be compensated,Relevant
Then  the client will receive a reduced list of the frequent damage and will be asked to select the damage concerned,Relevant
If the damage is not in this list  then it may be part of the list of damages not covered and  in this case  the customer will not be compensated,Relevant
Or the client may request to be put in contact with the CCM  customer communication management ,Relevant
However  if the damage has been found on the list  the process continues normally,Relevant
The client will then be asked whether or not it was a personal property,Relevant
If it is  then the client will give more information about the asset,Relevant
And if it is not  the process continues to the next step,Relevant
In that step  the client will have the opportunity to report another claim  if this is the case  the client will be sent back to the beginning of the process in order to give all the necessary information again,Relevant
If there is no further damage to report  then the customer will be asked for the owner s contact information,Relevant
Afterwards  the application will ask the customer if there is at least one property that belongs to the owner,Relevant
In both cases a summary adapted to the situation will be sent to the customer,Relevant
Finally  if the customer wishes to conclude and send the notification of the damages  he will have to click on  Envoyer   the damage will be transferred and the case will be finished,Relevant
Once the damage has been notified and that the claim has been transferred to  Ma demande   it will be transferred to the customer manager,Relevant
He will then process the claim  starting by judging whether or not it is important,Relevant
If the claim is significant  he will call in an expert to determine the amount of compensation,Relevant
Otherwise  he will define the amount himself on the basis of the information provided by the customer in the Flora application,Relevant
It is possible that the customer manager may not have the necessary information to calculate the refund,Relevant
In this case  he will send an e mail to the customer to request the missing information,Relevant
Once the amount of compensation has been determined  the customer manager will enter it into the application,Relevant
Then  if this amount is higher than 1000 euro  the Flora application must approve the compensation request before sending it to the customer,Relevant
If Flora detects a flaw  it will inform the customer manager who will re analyse the situation,Relevant
Otherwise  if Flora approves the request for compensation or in the event that the amount is less than 100 euro  the compensation proposal will be sent to the customer,Relevant
The next step depends on the client s approval of the compensation proposal,Irrelevant
If the customer approves  Flora will ask for the customer s bank account number and an electronic signature via ITSME,Relevant
Once the compensation proposal has been signed  the client will be reimbursed and will receive a notification that the file has been closed,Relevant
The client receives the compensation amount on his bank account and the process is thus completed,Relevant
If  on the other hand  the customer does not approve the compensation proposal  Flora will forward this refusal to the customer manager,Relevant
The acquisition of lands and buildings process by Spi follows a certain chain of events  decisions and actions,Irrelevant
First of all  they start by asking the government procurement if there is any land or buildings available,Relevant
In order to do this  they send a letter expressing their wish,Relevant
If there are no lands or buildings available  they express to the government procurement that they are aiming to buy  so they fill in a form to be added to the waiting list and they will be notified when an opportunity comes along,Relevant
If something is available  the procedure usually begins with an estimation of the property solicited by the government procurement,Relevant
Then  this estimation is reported to Spi,Relevant
Since Spi is aiming to rent or sell these acquisitions  before they buy lands and buildings  they need to be sure that they will bring interests to their clients,Relevant
So  they decide to carry out a market research and see if the assets are interesting enough,Relevant
If it is not interesting  they decide to drop off,Relevant
If it is interesting  then Spi asks their experts to carry out their own estimation of the asset,Relevant
If the estimation matches  they carry out the next step otherwise the company and the government procurement try to reach an agreement,Relevant
Without any agreement found  the company can decide to end the acquisition process,Relevant
After they agree on a price  Spi asks the bank if they are allowed to have a loan,Relevant
To do so  the financial department provides the bank with the expertise and the result of the market research,Relevant
Then  they have to wait 10 days to have a decision from the banker,Relevant
If after 10 days they don t have an answer  they can reschedule an appointment to have the final decision  usually if they don t have an answer after 10 days  it s because the loan has been rejected so during this second meeting  they will try to find a new arrangement ,Relevant
If no arrangement has been found  the process ends here,Relevant
The commercialization of plots of lands and building starts when Spi receives by email the interest of a client to buy a building or a plot of land,Relevant
Then  it has to acknowledge confirm the receipt in order to follow the sale,Relevant
Once  the receipt acknowledges  Spi has a free two month reservation to send a form to the candidate buyer,Relevant
This one fills out the request and sends it back to the company which has the duty to complete  sign and date the form,Relevant
Once  this first step done  Spi  executive board has one month to take a decision about the sale of its plots of land or building,Relevant
The agreement between these two parts remain valid for a period of six months,Relevant
Then  the company gives an agreement in principle to formalize the contract and the sales otherwise  if the candidate buyer doesn t respect this six month validity  Spi cancels the contract and the client is obliged to give 10% of the sum of the land or the building to the company  e g  when the client doesn t want to buy the land anymore before the 6 months ,Relevant
When the six months are respected  Spi will receive the 10% of the value of the land by the candidate buyer and it has to sign the deed,Relevant
Later  Spi checks if the payment is correct and if the reservation fee has been paid in one month,Relevant
Then  if all is done in the rules  Spi orders the measuring plan and the placement of markers on the sold property,Relevant
The reception of the proof credit from a bank by Spi leads to the selling of the land,Relevant
Otherwise  if the reservation fee is not received in one month  the order is rejected,Relevant
The Head of the rental department receives a request concerning the rental of a building,Relevant
He sends the request to the legal department  they check whether the request is complete and legal,Relevant
If the document is not complete  the client gets a message saying that he has to complete his documents,Relevant
If the document is complete  the head of the rental department schedules a meeting with the client,Relevant
During this meeting the client proposes a price,Relevant
If the price is too low the head of the department does a counterproposal  which is then accepted or not by the client,Relevant
When the client refuses  the negotiations are over and we consider the process done,Relevant
When a correct deal has been reached by the 2 parties  we draft a contract,Relevant
When the contract is signed the process has reached its end,Relevant
The appeal for intervention process in which the trigger event is the need for services such as reparations  gardening   Once the problem is identified  the maintenance department looks for companies with qualified people who could fill this need and then get in touch with that company,Relevant
They explain the need or issue,Relevant
If this person is indeed qualified for this request  a quote is asked,Relevant
When the quote from the company is received  the maintenance department examines it,Relevant
If it seems correct  they send it to the financial department which determines if it fits the company s budget in order to submit their agreement or not,Relevant
If they do agree  the maintenance department contacts the company again to complete the final terms and sign a contract,Relevant
Otherwise  they explain to the company that they do not want to go any further and restart the search for qualified people,Relevant
Once both parties have signed the contract  the financial department proceeds with the payment,Relevant
Finally  the maintenance department checks the service delivery to be sure that it is well done and that it meets their expectations,Relevant
The data analysis process is done in several steps  First  data analysts collect data from different sources for every sector,Relevant
Then  they merge the data from different sources and make a relation between them  unnecessary data is cleaned in order to concentrate on the economic analysis,Relevant
Data analysts analyze the evolution of the annual revenue of the companies for each sector and they combine the data of SPI with the one coming from the outside sources,Relevant
Finally  the results are interpreted  and the analysts make the best economic analysis possible and come to a conclusion,Relevant
The report of the analysis is then published in the database of the company  so that it is accessible to everyone,Relevant
Everything starts when a student is positive for the COVID 19,Relevant
The school will receive the information via email  phone or even via SMS,Relevant
Whether it s via phone  the school management will ask some specific questions such as   what was the last day in class  when did the student do the test  when did the student receive the results and so on,Relevant
Then they will fulfil the file with their own information such as the place where the student is sitting in class  the schedule from each class    To do so  they must dispose of the class plans,Relevant
Moreover  it should be done regarding one clear and precise model,Irrelevant
Once the file is completed  they can start analysing the information,Relevant
The first and the most important one is to know who the students with high risks are,Relevant
For that  they will consult the class plans and will make groups of students   those who are behind the positive student are not impacted  nevertheless those who are on both sides from this student are risky only if they have had close contact with the positive student without masks,Relevant
Unfortunately  this operation is hard  because of option courses,Irrelevant
Indeed  there are a lot of different class plans for these courses meaning that students are not always sitting next to the same students depending on the courses,Irrelevant
Once every single information has been collected  they will send the complete file to the Safety Advisor via email,Relevant
When she receives the email  she will make a first analysis then she will either transfer the file to the PSE  the School Medicine  or just will share the information that there is one more positive student in the school in order to receive a solution to implement,Relevant
However  if it is an urgent situation the school management will take the decision to close a class without consulting the PSE,Relevant
In the normal process  the PSE will analyse the sent file and will send instructions to the Safety Advisor who will send them to the school management,Relevant
On the one hand  students with high risks will receive a mail with the procedure to apply and a coming back date,Relevant
On the other hand  students with no risks will receive a small mail to be aware of the positive student,Relevant
If it is possible  one or two members of the school management will go to the concerned class to give some extra information about the s positive student and answer some questions,Relevant
If the class is closed  the school management will send another email to specify it,Relevant
Then they will phone each parent,Relevant
After that  each excluded student will receive work on the LMS platform and thereby a coming back date,Relevant
The process begins when a teacher is absent,Relevant
If the teacher is absent for more than 3 months  at least 15 weeks   then they have to hire a  priority temporary   that is a teacher who has already given lessons either in the school or in a group of schools attached to the school for at least 360 days  accumulated  not necessarily in the same school ,Relevant
In this case  the management looks in its database for a priority temporary,Relevant
If there is a priority temporary in the database  they contact him her by phone,Relevant
Finally  a management member sends the schedule of the teacher to be replaced to the substitute teacher and the teacher is replaced,Relevant
If the teacher is absent for less than a day  then he is not replaced,Relevant
However  if he she is absent for more than a day  then a substitute teacher must be found,Relevant
To find a substitute teacher  there are two possible ways  either the candidate has sent his her CV  printed and classified in a folder in order of importance of the title   or via the website  Primoweb   on which we will be able to go do a search according to the teacher you want to hire,Relevant
Management will be able to enter a series of criteria  such as the duration of the exercise  the branch of expertise and so on,Relevant
Then  after pushing on the search button  they can see the number of titles required  of sufficient titles and of shortage titles,Relevant
In the case of application by CV  the candidate selection sub process begins when the file containing the applications is opened  If there are required titles available  then these are directly selected,Relevant
Otherwise  we go to sufficient titles,Relevant
If there is no sufficient title  we move on to shortage titles,Relevant
If there is no shortage title  we move on to unlisted shortage titles,Relevant
In the case of a candidate who has none of these titles  it would be considered an error in the system  and the process would end,Relevant
Then  the CV is downloaded by all members of the management,Relevant
In the case of  Primoweb   we will first choose the required titles  then the sufficient titles  and then the shortage titles  the unlisted shortage titles are not listed on  Primoweb  ,Relevant
Then we send an email to the candidate,Relevant
If he she accepts  his CV is downloaded by all members of the management,Relevant
If he she refuses  then the management goes back to  Primoweb   and looks for another replacement  again in order of degree of importance,Relevant
If he she does not respond within 3 days  the management returns to  Primoweb   and searches for another replacement  always in order of degree of importance,Relevant
This process can sometimes take a very long time,Irrelevant
After downloading the candidate s CV  the members of the management will judge whether it is interesting or not,Relevant
If it s not interesting  that ends the process and the candidate is rejected,Relevant
If the CV is interesting  we are faced with 2 situations,Relevant
If the situation is urgent  for example when a teacher falls ill  then the substitute teacher is directly contacted by telephone to replace the absent teacher,Relevant
If the situation is not urgent  or at least foreseeable  for example in the case of a work stoppage related to pregnancy  then they will send an email to the candidate to prepare an interview,Relevant
The management team will then do the interview,Relevant
If the interview is successful  a member of the management phones the candidate to confirm the replacement of the teacher,Relevant
If the interview is not good  the candidate is rejected,Relevant
After calling the candidate  they usually send the schedule of the teacher to be replaced,Relevant
The process starts when the teacher wants to do an excursion with his students,Relevant
Once the teacher has found an excursion  he she has to download an excursion document located on the digital workspace of the school in order to complete the first point of the document,Relevant
Then he she has to send that document to the school management where they will check for the validity of the document,Relevant
If the document is not valid the process comes to an end and the excursion will not take place,Relevant
If the document is valid the school management has to decide if they want to let the teacher carry out the excursion or not,Relevant
If they decide to not give the permission to execute the excursion the process comes to an end,Relevant
If they decide to let the teacher do the excursion  they have to sign the document and send it to the accountant,Relevant
The accountant will then evaluate the price of the excursion and he she will inform the teacher,Relevant
The teacher will then inform the parents of the excursion and give them all the necessary information such as the location  the price  the date  and some general information about it,Relevant
After that  the teacher has to wait for the parents  decision to either let go or not their child on the excursion,Relevant
Once the teacher has received the parents  decision he she will book the excursion and carry it out,Relevant
Once the excursion is done the teacher has to complete the rest of the excursion document and to send it to the accountant,Relevant
The accountant will then complete the document with other necessary documents such as the invoice and he she will also mention the fees of the excursion in the periodic settlement of the students so that the fees will be added to what the parents have to pay at the end of the period,Relevant
After that the document is archived and the process is completed,Relevant
Because of the covid crisis  Sainte Véronique had to modify their organisation of parents  meeting process,Irrelevant
Indeed  parents cannot enter the school anymore,Irrelevant
The school tried the new process out in June last year and they improved it for this year,Irrelevant
The process starts when report cards are encoded in the specific software used by the school,Relevant
The student s report is then received by his or her parents,Relevant
In the report card  there is a comment section in which parents can find the teachers the school wants them to meet,Irrelevant
An online form is created on the LMS and sent to the parents for each year,Relevant
The questions are the following   first name and last name of the student  class  name of the person filling the form  phone number of this person  a multiple choice question with three time intervals and who are the three teachers the parents want to meet,Irrelevant
Once the due date to fill in the form is reached  the form is closed by the IT manager,Relevant
The form is exported in an Excel format and the table is shared with the teachers on the LMS,Relevant
The table is posted on the right year group,Relevant
Teachers can download the document and check whether the parents who were asked to meet them are on the list,Relevant
If they are not on the list the teacher has to add them,Relevant
Once it is done  the teacher can schedule the phone calls,Relevant
If needed  the school can provide some phones and a room for teachers to call the parents,Relevant
If during the parents  meeting the teachers notices an exceptional situation  he or she has to notify the school management,Relevant
The school management will then handle the case depending on the situation,Relevant
Every new year  Collège Sainte Véronique opens its enrolment process  which consists of registering first year students for the following academic year,Relevant
Before entering the heart of the process  the school has to achieve some optional or mandatory activities in order to prepare the enrolment period,Relevant
The mandatory one is to communicate the school capacity for first year students as well as the number of classes in the different sections  general path  immersion path ,Relevant
For the optional ones  on the one hand  they have the possibility to enter into partnerships with other institutions to facilitate the movement of students from one school to another,Relevant
On the other hand  a first contact may be organized,Relevant
Then  from February 10 th   the first enrollment phase starts and pupils can hand over their application form to the school,Relevant
Of course  the school must check if the application form is correct and well filled,Relevant
If it is not the case the application is refused and cancelled,Relevant
Next  we need to distinguish the first and the second enrolment phase because applications will not be handled in the same way,Relevant
Registration requests must therefore be allocated to the period corresponding to them,Relevant
The first phase begins on February 10 and ends on March 7  while the second phase is opened from April 27 to August 24,Relevant
First registration phase Each application for registration must first be registered and then updated in the register  which in most cases takes the form of a database,Relevant
In each application form there are two sections that have to be completed by parents,Irrelevant
The general part has to be hand written  but for the confidential part  parents have the choice to fill it online or in paper format,Relevant
If the parents choose the paper format  the school is responsible for mailing the confidential section to CIRI,Relevant
Otherwise  with the online form  the form is directly transmitted to CIRI,Relevant
Finally  the school sends a confirmation mail to say that the application has been handled correctly,Relevant
Once March 7 is reached  the school closes the first registration phase,Relevant
If there are more registrations than available places  pupils will be ranked according to different criteria by CIRI,Relevant
The ranking is used to attribute places to top ranked pupils,Relevant
The ranking and the result of the selection has to be sent to the pupil and parents,Relevant
If the pupil has been selected a registration certificate is created,Relevant
Else  the pupil is put on the waiting list,Relevant
If there were not more registrations than available places  a registration certificate is immediately created,Relevant
Second registration phase As for the first phase  the school has to register each application and update the register book,Relevant
However  it is not necessary to send the confidential section to CIRI because this part is used to make the ranking,Relevant
After that  either the school is already complete and the pupil has to be put on the waiting list  or there are still places left and a registration certificate can be immediately created for the pupil,Relevant
A student in phase 2 will not be given priority over a student in phase 1 in the waiting list,Relevant
From now the two phases can be gathered in one common path,Relevant
On the side of students who received a certificate of registration  the school has to request that the pupil provides his CEB,Relevant
If the CEB is received before September 1  the process carries on,Relevant
Else  the application will be rejected and a certified refusal letter with return receipt requested will be sent,Relevant
Then  at the start of the school year  attendance will be taken and if the pupil is not present  he will have to justify his non attendance within 8 days  otherwise he will be expelled,Relevant
On the side of students who are on the waiting list  they have to wait until a place becomes available,Relevant
If it is the case  the school will inform the pupil of the situation and will ask him whether he wants to take the place or not,Relevant
If so  then a registration certificate will be written  and the process will follow the normal path described earlier,Relevant
If the student refuses the place  then his application will be cancelled,Relevant
A student on the waiting list can also cancel his or her application by sending a message to the school,Relevant
And lastly the waiting list is closed on August 24  which means that all students still on it will receive a certificate of refusal,Relevant
The recruitment is dealt with by the administrator  Pierre Girretz  himself,Irrelevant
Indeed  as mentioned before  the company does not have an HR department nor a  true  recruitment system established since the administrator can easily do this type of work himself,Irrelevant
This process is triggered only when a new post is available  and it is done in a more or less informal but also classical way  he receives applications and reads the CVs  then Mr,Relevant
Girretz first checks if the applicant has the competencies required for the job  degree  experience    ,Relevant
If the resume does not correspond to what is expected  then the application is rejected by email with a thank you for sending the CV,Relevant
If the candidate seems to have the right competencies on paper  then he receives a notification to fix a date for an interview,Relevant
Right after the interview  the administrator evaluates the candidate on his personality,Relevant
Indeed  Mr  Girretz puts a lot of importance on his  gut feeling ,Irrelevant
So if the personality matches  then the candidate is given a trial period to see the quality of his work  see if he can work with the team  and to check if the person understands what the company needs and if he will be involved in the future,Relevant
If the candidate does not fulfill these characteristics  then his application is rejected after the trial period,Relevant
Otherwise  if the administrator is happy with his work  he scans the person s ID and bank cards and they both sign the hiring document given by Securex and finally  the applicant is officially hired after declaring the recruitment to the Dimona,Relevant
This process consists of the reception of the different supplies needed to build the pellet stoves,Irrelevant
First  the supplier receives a notification with the item Sûti needs  then they prepare the order and notifies the company when it is ready to be sent,Relevant
When the items are received  the head of the production checks their quality by following the production quality sheet s instructions and ticks the boxes corresponding,Relevant
If their quality is ok  then the item s QR codes are scanned to be registered on the system and then each item is placed at the post where it will be needed to build the stoves,Relevant
In other words  the head of the production paves the way for the  order preparation process ,Irrelevant
However  if the items are defective  then a letter is written to explain the problem to the supplier  and the supplies are sent back to receive better ones,Relevant
When a client wants to buy a stove  he needs to request a quote on Sûti s website and to choose from a list of characteristics his dream pellet stove,Relevant
Then  when the company receives it  assuming every item is in stock  the order preparation process can begin,Relevant
Employees working in the production line start by identifying the type of stove the client wishes to order  they write down the model  the power of the stove  optional features     and they also transfer the quote to the reseller  since he will be the one in charge of providing the final product to the customer,Relevant
After that  the production line checks if the items needed for assembly are in stock,Relevant
If not  an order request is sent to the supplier to receive the missing supplies,Relevant
When every item is in stock  employees search for pieces  emplacement in the system thanks to the QR code they scanned when they first received the items,Relevant
Then  the actual assembly can start  the goods go from post to post  the stove is built little by little at every step,Relevant
Once it reaches post number N  the number of posts depending on each case  the final product is fully built and is ready to go through a quality check,Relevant
Once this quality check process is done  the pellet stove is packaged in a plastic cover and a wood box,Relevant
Finally  it can be shipped to the reseller store  which will be in charge of selling the stove to the customer,Relevant
This process is basically about testing the stove from A to Z  looking for leaks  checking for malfunctions  and so on,Irrelevant
The quality check is once again done in the production line,Irrelevant
The process starts when a stove is done being assembled and ends when it is operational and can be sent to the reseller,Relevant
In the first step  the employees fill in the production quality sheet by first writing down the stove s info like the guaranteed number  the model  its options  the customer s details  and so on,Relevant
Next  the stove s components are checked and tested by following the sheet s instructions,Relevant
They then turn the engine on to check it works perfectly and that there is no leak or any other problem as said previously,Relevant
If there is an issue  then workers use the QR code system we talked about earlier to find which pieces are missing or misplaced in the stove and fix them,Relevant
When they are sure the stove is working well  they can start to suck potential dirt and clean the whole stove,Relevant
Once both are done  they stick an A   label and a CE  European Conformity  label on the door of the engine,Relevant
After that  the rest of the quality sheet has to be filled up,Relevant
Then an instruction sheet  a plan of the stove  and a list of the items are added to the packaging of the pellet stove,Relevant
In the end  the product is fully operational and is ready to leave the company,Relevant
The after sales process begins when a client needs professional intervention,Relevant
When the client wishes to do its stove s annual maintenance  a qualified operator is sent to its home,Relevant
In that case  it is not Sûti who is responsible for that operation  but the stoves reseller store  depending on the localization  stores in Belgium  France  Switzerland   ,Relevant
So Sûti s employees will not take care of the maintenance  but rather an external professional who has conducted one of Sûti s training or a mechanic who has Sûti s approval to operate on its stoves will do it,Relevant
If the client needs an intervention because its stove has a technical problem  then it contacts Sûti,Relevant
The administrator  the chief technician  and the head of the production can all take care of the process indifferently,Irrelevant
When the company is notified  it then fills in the after sales form by  between others  selecting the stove type and its features  the MAC   IP addresses of the stove  the type of service it needs  and by writing the customer s and the reseller s contact information,Relevant
If the stove needs a physical intervention because it cannot be dealt with remotely  then the problem is handed over to MILLE Services  a subsidiary company,Relevant
After receiving information on the problem  this company will then send one of its technicians to repair the stove  then the after sales form will be signed by both the customer and MILLE Services,Relevant
Otherwise  if physical intervention is not necessary  which is mostly the case  then Sûti will solve the problem remotely through the internet thanks to the app it recently developed,Relevant
So first  they will use this app to detect the problem on the stove  then they will change the engine s parameters through the remote control system and will fill in the sheet with every problem encountered while doing so,Relevant
When they are done  they check if the stove is operational,Relevant
If so  the after sales document is signed and the process is over,Relevant
If not  then the stove will need a supplementary intervention physically  thus Sûti contacts MILLE Services and the service is handed to them as stated previously,Relevant
This process begins with the registration of the quotation,Relevant
When the welder load is planned  he will assign a design engineer to the project,Relevant
First of all  the planner will plan the welder load,Relevant
After that  several things will be made simultaneously,Relevant
  On the one hand  the quality manager will design the quality plan,Relevant
  On the other hand  the design engineer will first analyze the file in order to be able to draw the nomenclature of the project,Relevant
After that  the welding engineer will give the soudage instructions,Relevant
Then the process will continue with the calculation engineer who will make the calculation,Relevant
When these two simultaneous parts of the process will be covered  the pawn can move on to the resolution of questions task  executed by the design engineer,Relevant
When all the questions will be covered  it is the task of the project manager to validate the project,Relevant
Now  it will be up to the client to look at the drawing to approbate it in order to launch the creation of the project,Relevant
If the customer has other questions  he will send an email to the company to disapprove the drawing,Relevant
The design engineer will be obliged to do the task of questions resolution again,Relevant
If the customer approves the drawing  the company will receive an email from him,Relevant
After having received the customer approbation  the company will purchase its raw materials,Relevant
The project will then be sent to the workshop,Relevant
Two sub processes will then be required simultaneously,Relevant
The production traceability and the inspection,Relevant
After that  the calculation note will be drafted by the calculation engineer and the welding book by the welding engineer,Relevant
The plan  as built  will then be drawn,Relevant
The process ends with the expedition,Relevant
It is important to know that Into this process  each thing that will be associated with creation or assignment will be included in the ERP in the file created in the quotation registration,Irrelevant
The process begins when the purchasing department receives a purchase need,Relevant
They will first analyze the request,Relevant
Then  they will check if an authorized provider exists,Relevant
In fact  they must have to work with suppliers accepted by Ortmans in order to be certain of the quality of the service,Irrelevant
If a valid supplier exists for the requirement then we send him a request for quotation If this is not the case  the quality assurance manager will seek out a new supplier and evaluate it,Relevant
Once this is done  we can send the request for a quote,Relevant
When the purchasing department receives the quote  it is analyzed and then an order is sent to the supplier,Relevant
Once the order is received by the storekeeper  he will check the quantity received via the shipping document,Relevant
If a control card exists  then a quality controller must inspect the delivery qualitatively,Relevant
Then the conformity is checked via the ERP by the storekeeper,Relevant
If the order is compliant then it synchronizes the receipt of the order in the ERP and the purchase is complete,Relevant
If the order is non compliant  then the quality assurance manager will initiate a process to manage non compliance,Relevant
Once this is completed  the storekeeper can synchronize the receipt of the order in the ERP and the purchase will be completed,Relevant
At another time  the billing department will receive the invoice of the order  which will start their process,Relevant
This will be checked in the ERP,Relevant
Once the service is notified that the receipt of the order has been synchronized in the ERP  it can proceed to the payment and the payment will be completed,Relevant
The improvement action process starts with an improvement demand based on different sources  internal or external audit report  management review  customer complaint  non compliance  suggestion etc,Relevant
The request is then registered in the Excel table by the Quality Assurance Manager  Q A M  ,Relevant
This excel file will be used all along the process,Irrelevant
It is important to detect the issue  which means that an analysis of the problem in order to know the ins and outs of each approach will be conducted by the Q A M,Relevant
Then the Q A M  will conduct a criticality analysis in order to put the necessary resources on the actions that require it,Relevant
A corresponding amelioration file will be created in the excel table,Relevant
It will help in the choice of whether or not to initiate an improvement action,Irrelevant
When the amelioration file is finished  the Q A M will be able to analyse the issue properly,Relevant
If there is no improvement needed  the Q A M will answer to the improvement demand applicant with  if possible  an explanation for the refusal,Relevant
However  if an improvement is needed  the Q A M will determine the action with a reasonable timeframe and a person responsible for the action,Relevant
Those elements will also be added to the excel file,Relevant
When the action and those who are in charge of it are defined  the Q A M will inform the direction,Relevant
When the direction is informed of the issue  she provides the necessary means  and then launches the action,Relevant
The Implementation of the improvement action is then carried out by the action responsible,Relevant
In parallel  the Q A M follows up this implementation of the improvement action,Relevant
When the improvement action is finished  the Q A M  checks the effectiveness of the action implemented  i e  checking that the action focuses on the causes and not only on the consequences,Relevant
If the result is satisfying  the improvement action process ends there,Relevant
Otherwise  the criticality analysis must be reseen and the process starts again from this point,Relevant
The process starts when an unconformity is detected,Relevant
A non conformity must be declared when one or more of the following conditions are met ,Irrelevant
  Immediate repair at no significant cost is not possible,Irrelevant
  Immediate repair at low cost is possible but the problem is recurrent,Irrelevant
  Immediate low cost repair is possible but can lead to an opportunity for improvement,Irrelevant
   Supplier  defect  which includes not only raw material suppliers but also service providers and subcontractors ,Irrelevant
  Customer complaint is the subject of a complaint and therefore a  complaint  sheet is completed and if necessary  a  non conformity  sheet is completed,Irrelevant
The initials of the initiator with the date are added on the sticker who must be created to mark the non conformity,Relevant
Next  they have to fill in the non conformity sheets so that they do not have to search for information that is known to the initiator,Relevant
The NCS is transmitted to the QAM who is responsible for its follow up,Relevant
Record in Excel file for follow up,Relevant
The QAM communicates the NCS to the PM  Project manager ,Relevant
The person who is responsible for the non compliance is the quality manager,Irrelevant
This is the quality manager who makes a proposal for action at the project manager,Relevant
It is the PM who makes the decision whether or not to accept this proposal for action,Relevant
If the answer is no  the quality manager must make another proposal for action,Relevant
If it is approved  the project manager notifies the client and waits to receive the formal acceptance of the client,Relevant
If the client doesn t accept  it is up to the quality manager to remake another proposal action,Relevant
Both QAM and the quality manager must decide for verifications to do if the client accepts the proposal action,Relevant
Now it is up to the quality manager to make improvement actions and verify these actions back,Relevant
He will close the NCS  remove the marking  non conformity  and notify the QAM who shall verify the process  make analysis,Relevant
After the analysis  if he decides that other improvement actions must be taken  they will make a new one,Relevant
If not  they will archive the non conformity,Relevant
The process starts when a client needs new equipment and asks the company for a quotation,Relevant
The project manager receives the request and analyzes it in terms of solvency of the client and in terms of capacity of the company to produce the client s equipment,Relevant
An acknowledgment of receipt is sent to the client,Relevant
The project manager asks the management for an approval and  depending what the management will decide  the client s request will be approved or not,Relevant
If the request is rejected  the project manager will send a rejection to the client  otherwise  the process continues  and the project s file is created with an ERP s number,Relevant
Then  the design office makes an analysis of the different technical aspects and a quotation request is sent to the supplier,Relevant
Finally  with all the information received  the project manager makes the quote  and then  asks the management for some advice about the quote,Relevant
Afterward  the project manager establishes the offer  which is registered in the ERP   and sends it to the client,Relevant
If the client accepts the offer  the project manager receives the order form,Relevant
The order form is registered in the ERP system and a confirmation is sent to the client,Relevant
The contract is reviewed by the project manager  the file is prepared  and information is sent for the registration to delivery process and the quotation registration process is ended,Relevant
This process happens repeatedly throughout the day to journalists,Relevant
Indeed  they have to write several articles for the next day s daily journal,Irrelevant
The main subject of an article usually comes from an informant with a scoop   last minute information or from requests for coverage or news they received  for example through the  alert us  button of their website ,Irrelevant
Daily news and important events have priority over more common subjects,Irrelevant
Therefore  if crucial information is given by someone with a high position or an informant to a journalist  he must not hesitate to dive in and collect more information about it,Irrelevant
Once the subject is received or chosen  the first step is confirming the information with a reliable person,Relevant
We will consider Liège s Christmas market cancellation as an example,Irrelevant
The journalist obtaining this information then has to ask Liège s mayor to confirm it,Relevant
However  if the information comes from the  alert us  button  the journalist will set up a meeting with the person in order to further analyze it,Relevant
A subject with incoherent or false information will be rejected  whereas the process will continue for a reliable and true subject,Relevant
If a journalist were to obtain crucial information  it must be published  even partially  as soon as possible so that it is not stolen from the competition,Relevant
Thus  it is directly posted on Sudpresse s paying website,Relevant
On the contrary  if the information can wait  the journalist should collect more details about it,Relevant
Once it is done  the journalist makes a synthesis of the information he has received to this point  to know what he should search next,Relevant
In both cases  phone calls  emails and internet researches will follow in order to complete and detail the current subject,Relevant
The information research process ends as soon as the journalist has gathered enough detailed information to write the article,Relevant
The journalist is responsible for this process from its start to its end,Irrelevant
Sometimes  as demonstrated in the previous process  information must be revealed without delay to readers with a subscription,Irrelevant
That is why the information  written as quickly as possible  will be briefly explained on Sudpresse s paying website,Irrelevant
Following this event  a strategic marketing employee in the  newsroom  creates a teasing placed on the free website,Relevant
This teasing includes a link to the company s paying website,Irrelevant
Afterwards  the journalist will progressively continue filling out the online article on the paying website  adding information and upgrading the layout  until it is complete and perfect,Relevant
The journalist contacts his sources to find new he can add to his article,Relevant
If he gets new information from a tier  he contacts this tier  that becomes thus one of a source  or any other source who can verify clarify this new information,Relevant
The last version of the online article will be published the next morning in the traditional newspaper,Relevant
Compared to a few years ago  journalists do not write complete articles that only come out the following day as they first have to post them online,Irrelevant
This applies to any level of importance of the information,Irrelevant
Then  once the article has been completed and is published on the different websites  and when  due to the tight timing  the article must be finished to be in the next day s newspaper  the journalist asks for a page of the next day s daily journal and starts copying the article s content,Relevant
