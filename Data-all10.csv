 Finally  leave to cool before unmoulding,Relevant
 Thank you for following my recipe!,Irrelevant
This is the process of offering a gift for a birthday,Irrelevant
The process start when I decide if I will buy the gift in one of the online applications or in a store,Relevant
If I m busy  I use the online applications  if I m not  I buy in a store,Relevant
If I decide to buy the gift online  I take a look in all online sites to find the gift corresponding to my budget and the offers,Relevant
If i choose what I m going to buy  the application check if I have already entered my data  if not  the application demands my data,Relevant
Then  I enter my credit card data and execute the payment  if I have enough money to execute the operation  then it will be executed  if not  the application will cancel my demand,Relevant
Aftrewards  if the operation went well  I choose if I sign on the arrival of purchased item or not,Relevant
Then the application gives me an estimated waiting time to receive the item,Relevant
Finally  when the time of reception of the item arrives  the deliverer comes to the address indicated in the application to give me the article,Relevant
I sign in his phone or in a paper that I received my order,Relevant
If I decide to buy the gift in a store  I go to see several stores,Relevant
When I choose what i m going to buy,Relevant
Then I choose if I m going to pay by cash or by credit card,Relevant
If I pay by cash  I give the salesperson the price of the item,Relevant
If not I pay by credit card  I enter the card code  and I take the gift,Relevant
In the end  I give my friend the gift,Relevant
This process is about looking for an internship,Irrelevant
I determine the sector in which I will be staging,Relevant
Then I establish a CV according to the sector I have chosen,Relevant
To apply for companies  I can either apply online or submit the CV to the company in person,Irrelevant
If I choose to apply online  I must post the CV on the site or send it by email to the targeted company,Relevant
If not  I drop it off in person,Relevant
In both cases  the company asks me to do a pre internship interview if they like my CV  if not  they have to inform me by phone or by email that my CV is not congruent to their criteria,Relevant
If I pass the interview  I start my internship directly  if not I will have to see another company,Relevant
 A customer needs new kid toys for his kid,Irrelevant
 The process starts when the customer clicks on order button and places his order  ,Relevant
 My store receives the order and informs me by a notification  ,Relevant
 I check the availability of the product from my supplier  ,Relevant
 If it is out of stock  the customer will get informed by a message and he reject his order manually or get his money back automatically  ,Relevant
 If the product still exists in the stock  I confirm his order  ,Relevant
 I ship his items attached with Invoice  ,Relevant
 After a given days  the customer receives his order ,Relevant
 New customer enters our agency,Relevant
 We check if he already exists in our database,Relevant
 If he exists  we propose him our services ,Relevant
 If he does not exist  we create a new account and then propose our services,Relevant
 If he reject our proposal  the process ends,Relevant
 If he accepts our services  we register his demand,Relevant
 We give him an appointment,Relevant
 After one week he still can refuse the demand or confirm,Irrelevant
Then  he receives the command,Relevant
The process is finished,Relevant
The process begins when someone is declaring a damage for which he wants to be compensated,Relevant
For that  he has several ways to state the incident,Irrelevant
The choice will impact the way the clerk will address the issue,Irrelevant
The claim management officer will firstly check if the person declaring is an actual client of Ethias,Relevant
For the application or the website channel  this check will be done by the person itself,Relevant
Obviously  the victim must be a client of Ethias in order to be compensated  if not  the process ends here by informing the victim the steps that he should follow in order to be eligible for the coverage,Relevant
In some cases  when the incident is claimed by phone  the clerk starts by asking the victim if he or she needs some support such as a tow truck for instance,Relevant
Then the victim will share key information with the officer of the claims management department to make the declaration,Relevant
Whether it is by phone or by mail  the information is transcribed into the IT system,Relevant
If the declaration is done via the form in the application or website of Ethias  the information ends up directly in the IT system,Relevant
After that  the case is opened for the client and the process may continue with the case instruction and examination to see if it meets the conditions to compensate the victim,Relevant
To this end  the clerk will assess if there is a matter of liability in the case or not  as well as checking if the client contract covers the damage that occurred and assessing the level of damage by means of experts or by his experience,Relevant
At the same time  the case handler decides which type of reservation the case should follow,Relevant
In the perspective of an actuarial reservation  he informs the actuarial department by sending the case to it,Relevant
In the other perspective  the clerk defines the amount to reserve by himself and sends it to the actuarial department to be approved,Relevant
The case handler sees if the coverage conditions are fulfilled  that is to say that for cases of engaged liabilities the client should be considered liable  otherwise it s not up to his insurance to compensate,Relevant
The other condition is that the contract should cover the damage,Relevant
In the end  a notification with the outcome will be sent to the client and if these conditions are well fulfilled  Ethias will compensate for the damage,Relevant
The case is finally settled or unsettled,Relevant
In order to understand the reservation process better  it is necessary to clarify its purpose in the context of an insurance company  reservation allows Ethias to deal with future compensation needs by means of statistical computation techniques   for example  someone broke his leg this year and because of that  he might have complications like a need for a surgery years later,Relevant
Then  his insurance will have to compensate him once again,Relevant
That s why  on the insurance side  they have to make a reservation in order to be prepared for these cases,Irrelevant
As seen in the claims management process  the clerk decides which type of reservation is needed based on his evaluation,Relevant
Actuarial reservation only deals with cases considered as recurrent and with a higher level of generality  also  they are most of the time short term cases,Irrelevant
Otherwise  the clerk determines and evaluates by himself the amount to reserve but still sends it to the actuarial department for approbation,Relevant
So for this process  when the claim management officer informs the actuary that the case needs an actuarial reservation  the latter collects all the data regarding the case by means of a database,Relevant
Then he analyzes it in order to fix new hypotheses which will be used for computation,Relevant
This computation is handled by a mathematical program,Relevant
Nevertheless  to find which model to use  the actuary follows precise guidelines and rules,Irrelevant
The outcome of this computation will be checked by the actuarial control 4,Relevant
If changes are needed  the actuary will adjust his model and repeat the computation,Relevant
After the approbation by the actuarial control  the assessment of the case is sent to the accounting department in order to be accounted for,Relevant
It s up to the actuary to communicate the reservation to the accounting department,Relevant
To initiate this process  a product manager from the marketing or sales department requests to price a product,Relevant
Then the actuary team of the tarification department will gather data and statistics about the type of incidence that the service covers,Relevant
The Ethias database is filled with information in order to develop a technical model of tarification to take into account the specific risks and give a first price for the premium,Relevant
But this price does not always comply with the market demand and customer needs  this is the reason why the actuary team and the product manager exchange information to compute a model more suitable for the market,Relevant
This second version of the model will be sent to the actuarial control in order to be reviewed and to check the perspective of profitability with the business plan,Relevant
When the review is done  if changes are needed the actuary team takes care of remodelling it and shows the model to the actuarial control once again until it s validated by it,Relevant
This validation must be followed by the agreement of all the stakeholders that are linked with this pricing process,Relevant
Their agreement is necessary before establishing the tariff and sending it to the product manager,Irrelevant
The underwriting process begins when a demand for insurance coverage is perceived by the sales department,Relevant
This demand is sent either by a peer to peer procedure between Ethias and the organisation  by a broker as an intermediate of the concerned company or by a tendering procedure on public markets,Relevant
This distinction doesn t change the process in essence  but rather in the outcomes and the channel of communication,Irrelevant
Then the demand is transferred into the CRM system of Ethias either by the sales officer or  in some cases  automatically,Relevant
Next  the sales officer checks if this demand comply with the business guidelines of Ethias in strategic or relationship terms,Relevant
Generally  the case complies and continues its path towards the underwriting department to follow two successive analysis procedures  first  an acceptance analysis which is made in order to make the decision to keep such demand or to reject it,Relevant
If the underwriter doesn t accept it then the process ends  otherwise he proceeds  in a second time  to a tarification analysis,Relevant
These two phases are modelled as subprocesses which consist of multiple tasks that should be done before setting the tariff and the offer,Relevant
In addition  a competence scheme helps to decide whether the offer needs to be agreed by two other third parties  BOL and HAC  or not  depending on the offer,Irrelevant
They can eventually ask for adjustment before pursuing the process,Relevant
Later on  if the third parties agreed when needed  the underwriter decides the channel through which he will make the offer,Relevant
Considering the circumstances  he has 3 possibilities  the offer could either be led directly towards the client through the CRM system  be led to an account manager  ACMA  that will defend the offer in front of the call for tenders or be placed in a share application for the sales department that will handle it from there,Relevant
The outcome of the offer will be communicated through the same channel used to make the offer,Relevant
The last tasks for the underwriter are to settle all the paperwork and then  depending on the outcome  to classify the case or not  if the outcome is negative  he must do so  if it is positive  the onus is not on him to do that and the process is over,Relevant
This process begins when a client requests insurance coverage,Relevant
He has the choice to fill in the subscription form digitally or to have contact with a clerk in an agency or via phone call,Relevant
The sales officer of the front office will define what services the customer needs and check if he is already a client in Ethias,Relevant
If it s not the case  the clerk affiliates him by asking for personal information,Relevant
Then the officer will check the client s incident data in DataSure  which is a database to centralise all the declared incidences from any insurance company  in order to decide if he is eligible for the services needed,Relevant
If he is not eligible  the rejection is communicated directly after this verification,Relevant
Either way  the clerk makes the first quotation with the information gathered and hands in to the client or sends it via letter or email if the request is made via phone call,Relevant
The client reviews it  fills it with extra information needed to establish any contracts and sends it back via the channel of his choice,Relevant
If it is physically  then the clerk decides if it meets the criteria of acceptance by analysing the risk,Relevant
The rejection is also communicated to the client after this verification,Relevant
If accepted  the clerk makes changes if needed by taking into account the review of the client and the extra information,Relevant
Then the contract is printed and given to the client and waited to be signed,Relevant
If it is digitally  the back office takes care of making the verification with the criteria and establishing the contract by taking into account all the data,Relevant
All this procedure is simplified if the client firstly decides to fill the subscription digitally,Relevant
For that he needs to be affiliated and this is made possible thanks to the website or the application,Irrelevant
The subscription form and client s data are sent directly to the back office to be evaluated and analysed,Relevant
The officer checks with the criteria of acceptance and decides whether to send a rejection or to establish and send the contract to be signed by the client,Relevant
The process starts when an employee is sick or absent for whatever reason,Relevant
The first step of the process has to be done by the employee  he has to send his medical certificate to the human resources and at the  same time   he has to contact them in order to inform them of the duration of its absence,Relevant
Thanks to this  the human resources can start their own process in which they try to replace him by someone,Relevant
Then  after both of these tasks have been completed  the next tasks will mainly concern the human resources department,Relevant
They have to sort out the different types of medical certificates  check if they are certificates without pathologies or certificates with pathologies,Relevant
On the one hand  if and only if the certificate is without any pathology  the human resources employee has to check it and verify if the certificate is valid,Relevant
Then  he has to verify some little things like the start of the absence  the end of it  and then he has to send a mail to SPCM to prevent them,Relevant
Following this  at the same time  he has to encode this absence in the system in order that all the organization can be aware of the absence of the employee and he has to notify the medical advisor too  and then the medical advisor will have to choose whether the veracity of this absence must be checked or not,Relevant
On the other hand  if and only if this certificate contains pathologies  the human resources employee has to send it directly to the  Service Provincial de contrôle médical  and has to fulfill a form,Relevant
After that  the SPCM checks if the certificate is correct and if there is any problem,Relevant
After that  he then gives his accord to the organization to encode this,Relevant
So  the human resources employee can encode this in the database,Relevant
Afterwards  at the same time  they have to notify the medical advisor  and then the medical advisor chooses to check the veracity of this absence or not  and  the human resources employee can check the date  the absence  etc,Relevant
After that  in addition they receive the acknowledgement of receipt and finally they can put the certificate in the HR certificate folder and the process is over,Relevant
The process starts at the end of the month when it is time to pay the different employees in the company,Relevant
We should note that almost the entire process is carried out by human resources,Irrelevant
Firstly  at the same time  the human resources employee is doing 4 different tasks  which are  check for extra hours  check leaving request  check attendance system in order to know how many hours the employee worked and then check it with the system  Unitime,Relevant
  Finally  he checks sickness  so if an employee was absent and then uses HR Accent in order to verify this,Relevant
When all these 4 steps are finally done  he writes a recap  with all the information so he can export them to Securex,Relevant
Securex checks the feedback and sends it to the human resources,Relevant
After receiving the feedback from Securex  the human resources employee treats the document in order to make a proposal for the salary,Relevant
After receiving the proposition  there is a question within the HR   are we agree with this proposition?  If no  the process restarted at the proposition of wage slip,Relevant
If the response is yes  we can continue the process,Relevant
Human resources can then send the payment permission to Securex and wait until the reception of Securex agreement,Relevant
Subsequently  several things have to be done at the same time  we are going to describe them branch by branch,Irrelevant
Firstly  in the first branch he receives the  décompte de paye  and then prints it in order to send the file to the employee,Relevant
Afterwards  there is a question   Is there any contestation?  If there is no contestation  we can continue and finalize the process with the acceptation of Securex payment,Relevant
But  if there is a contestation  we have to ask the CEO what to do with it and then a new process starts,Relevant
Finally  on the other branch  things that need to be done first are to ask Securex to prepare the invoice  then we are waiting until Securex creates it  and sends it,Relevant
After this  there is another question   Are we sending this to accounting or not?  If the answer is  yes   we can accept Securex s payment and the process ends,Relevant
And if no  once again we have to ask the CEO what to do,Relevant
This process starts when an application is sent by a candidate to the HR which do a first sorting and then a second one,Relevant
After this  the first interview take place,Relevant
Then we are in the first question which is  Is this a key position or not?  If yes  we need to know if we need complementary assessments    if yes  a specialist office makes a couple of tests and then sends the results to the HR,Relevant
After this  we conclude whether it is okay or not,Relevant
If it is not  we can dismiss the application and inform the applicant of that,Relevant
We therefore destroy these data,Relevant
But if it is okay  we arrive to the second interview which is important,Relevant
  If it is not necessary to get more assessments  we can go directly to the second interview,Relevant
So  at this moment  we are at the same point,Irrelevant
After the interview  there is a selection  if the candidate is not selected  then we can dismiss the application and inform the applicant of that  and destroy its data,Relevant
But if the candidate is selected  then HR sends a notification to the applicant and welcomes him as a new worker,Relevant
If it is not a key post  we are directly in the step of selection,Relevant
So  if the candidate is not selected  then we can dismiss the application and inform the applicant of that  and destroy its data,Relevant
But if the candidate is selected  then HR sends a notification to the applicant and welcomes him as a new worker,Relevant
The process starts when the financial department picks up an invoice in order to pay it,Relevant
It should be noted that the file in question is recuperated in the ISABEL system,Relevant
Firstly  the financial department employee prints the details of payment,Relevant
After this  he shows the file to the financial director,Relevant
Afterwards  he needs to classify the invoices according to whether they are above 150 000 euros or under 150 000 euros,Relevant
  When we are under 150 000  the financial employee just has to inform the HR department,Relevant
  When we are above 150 000  he has to ask the financial director to find out if it is okay,Relevant
After these steps  we follow the same path in both cases  and the process stays located in the financial and accounting department,Relevant
Then  the employee verifies the liquidity on the account in order to know if there are no problems with the treasury,Relevant
After that  he can send money to the bank account  send an email to CBC bank with the details of payment and finally register the payment in the SAP system  before ending with the receiving of the account statement,Relevant
This process starts when a client asks for an intervention,Relevant
This request is directly registered in a file,Relevant
Then  it must be checked if the intervention is included in the contract,Relevant
  If it is not  the client must be asked whether he agrees with the financial part and then the client must respond to this in order for the organization to get his feedback  If he doesn t agree  the process stops,Relevant
But if he agrees  the organization can define the costs of the intervention,Relevant
  If yes  the organization can define the costs,Relevant
After this  at that moment we are on the same track  it should be chosen if we need an internal quote or an external one,Relevant
We then arrive to 2 different questions  The first one is   Do we need an accord regarding the quote?      If the answer is  yes   the approbation of the client has to be asked,Relevant
If his answer is that it is okay  he must be informed about the start of the intervention,Relevant
Then the intervention is finished,Relevant
But if he refuses the quote  the process ends again,Relevant
  If the answer is  no   the client must be informed about the start of the intervention and also when it will be finished,Relevant
The process starts when a customer makes a request to open close the P1 S1 port  these are ports on the smart meter that allow the customer to connect their application on which they can consult their energy consumption in real time ,Relevant
The call is received by an interlocutor  called Connexio  working for a defined network distribution manager  in our case for ORES obviously ,Relevant
The Connexio will then control whether the customer is addressing the correct DNM using an identification database,Relevant
If it is the wrong DNM  the Connexio informs the customer and the call ends,Relevant
Once the DNM check has been carried out  he will proceed to a process check,Relevant
If it is a High Voltage process  the customer is redirected to another service  otherwise if the process is Low Voltage  the Connexio identifies the requester thanks to the database of municipalities and social housing then controls the verbal offer,Relevant
If it is not a verbal offer  the request is transferred to the  Connection Work  process,Relevant
If it is a verbal offer  the process continues and the Connexio controls the file,Relevant
If the file is existing  he informs the client and the process ends  otherwise  he communicates the price of the service to the customer and reads the GDPR disclaimer in case of an opening  then waits for the client s response,Relevant
If the client accepts  a file is created,Relevant
Otherwise the file is immediately closed and the process ends,Relevant
After having created the file  the Connexio asks if the client is able to receive a remote operation  if he is not able  he asks whether the preparatory work is the client s responsibility,Relevant
If he is able  is the client s request unique? If the client s request is not unique  he asks if the preparatory work is the client s responsibility  otherwise he asks directly what type of appointment to make,Relevant
Concerning the preparatory work  if they are not the client s responsibility  then the Connexio asks what type of appointment to make,Relevant
But if they are the responsibility of the customer  the Connexio informs the customer about the preparatory work  he waits for a response  if the customer does not accept  the file is closed and the process ends,Relevant
If he accepts then he also asks what type of appointment to make,Relevant
There are two types of appointments  The first one is if remote operations work  from June 2020   the Connexio sends confirmation to the customer but also to the control room that the thing has been taken into account,Relevant
The control room receives this remote operation request for opening   closing port P1   S1 and the process is terminated,Relevant
The second one is if the technician has to come to the customer s house  the Connexio controls the duration of the intervention  he schedules an appointment  if the intervention cannot be scheduled  the Connexio records the non schedulable intervention request and the call ends ,Relevant
After scheduling the appointment  he sends the appointment confirmation to the client  waits for the appointment confirmation,Relevant
After receipt  he sends the work order to the technician,Relevant
The technician receives the file and the process ends,Relevant
The process is separated in 2 lanes  fieldworker and Work control OSP,Irrelevant
The process starts with the reception of a request to install a smart meter for the activation of prepayment mode,Relevant
All the processes arrive at the same gateway so I will describe each process up to the point of intersection and then explain what happens after,Relevant
1  The customer was present and another customer was present,Relevant
If the customer wants a recovery  they process it to a recovery form,Relevant
If the customer doesn t want a recovery then they see if it is their first visit  a  2  Another customer was not present and the customer accepts the installation,Relevant
 b They check the communication network coverage,Relevant
If the communication network coverage is adequate they check for fraud,Relevant
If there is a suspected fraud they send the information to the fraud department and they wait for the attention return from the fraud service which sends an end signal to fraud management,Relevant
 c  After that  whether there is fraud or not  if there is not a smart technical impossibility they replace the meter with a smart meter,Relevant
If there is a smart technical impossibility and an electromechanical technical impossibility they send the information of non execution of the installation for technical impossibility,Relevant
If there is not an electromechanical technical impossibility they put a budget meter and activate prepayment mode,Relevant
If the communication network coverage is not adequate and there is a possibility for deporting the antenna  they move the antenna to another area covered by the network and follow  c ,Relevant
If there is no possibility for deporting the antenna they check the electromechanical technical possibility  such as in c ,Relevant
Another customer was not present and the customer does not accept the installation,Relevant
If the client is electro sensitive then the process goes directly to the checking of the electromechanics technical impossibility  in the c ,Relevant
If the client is not electro sensitive and it is their  a  first visit the process goes directly to the point of intersection,Relevant
If it is not their  a  first visit but it is their second visit and the meter installation is possible before shutdown then the process continues to point  b ,Relevant
If the meter installation is not possible before shutdown and a meter cut is possible  2 things happen simultaneously,Relevant
The first is checking if the meter installation is possible  if yes it goes to  b  if not it goes to the point of intersection,Relevant
The second is to send the cutout start execution request to the meter and then wait for the message of the smart meter cut back,Relevant
If there is no cancellation request they perform the cut on the meter,Relevant
 d  After that an effective cutoff confirmation is filed which sends a message to the customer then they send the effective cutoff information which lead to the intersection point and  e  in the Work control OSP lane receiving information on the execution of cuts which send an end signal of management of cut returns,Relevant
 f  If there is a cancellation request the process goes to the intersection point,Relevant
If a meter cut is not possible  g  they check the possibility of a network cut,Relevant
If a network cut is possible they send the request to start the execution of the network cut then wait for the message to start network cut back,Relevant
If there is a cancellation request the process arrives at  f  and if not they execute the cut network then follow  d ,Relevant
If a network cut is not possible they send the non cut information which simultaneously lead the process to the intersection point and in  h  the work control OSP lane receive the information about non execution of cuts which send an end signal of post administration,Relevant
3  The customer was not present and it is the first visit,Relevant
If the meter is not accessible the process goes directly to the intersection point,Relevant
If the meter was accessible  they check the communication network coverage,Relevant
 i  If the communication network coverage is adequate they check for fraud,Relevant
If there is a suspected fraud they send the information to the fraud department and wait for the attention return from the fraud service which sends an end signal to fraud management,Relevant
 j  After that  whether there is fraud or not  if there is not a smart technical impossibility the meter is replaced with a smart meter and the process goes to the intersection,Relevant
If there is a smart technical impossibility and an electromechanical technical impossibility the information is sent of non execution of the installation for technical impossibility,Relevant
If there is not an electromechanical technical impossibility they put an electromechanics budget meter and activate prepayment mode,Relevant
If the communication network coverage is not adequate and there is a possibility for deporting the antenna  the antenna is moved to another area covered by the network and follow  j ,Relevant
If there is no possibility for deporting the antenna they check the electrical technical possibility  such as in j ,Relevant
4  The customer was not present and it is not the first visit,Relevant
If it is their second visit and a meter installation is possible before shutdown they follow  i ,Relevant
If it is not their second visit or it is their second visit but the meter installation is not possible before shutdown  they check if a network cut is possible,Relevant
If yes  they send a request to start execution of the network cut and wait for a message of network cut back,Relevant
If there is a cancellation request the process goes to the intersection point and if not  they cut the installation  file an effective cutoff notice which sends a message to the customer and send confirmation of effective shutdown which leads the process to the intersection point and in the work control OSP lane  following  e ,Relevant
If the network cut is not possible the information is sent of the non execution of the cut which lead the process to the intersection point and in the work control OSP lane  following  h ,Relevant
All of these lead to one gateway  after that they complete the worksheet,Relevant
If the client is present  they sign the worksheet and if they are not a calling card is left for the customer which sends a message to them,Relevant
Both of them lead to saving the worksheet and ending the process in the Work control OSP lane with post administration,Relevant
This process is divided into 5 lanes  planned works  technical solution officer  supervisor  manager and CTM coordinator,Irrelevant
The process starts at planned works when an appointment s planning is needed,Relevant
First thing is to know if it is a grid construction work or not,Relevant
If it is not a grid construction work  planned works assess if it is a civil engineering operation,Relevant
If it is a civil engineering operation  they find out if there is an authorization or an information request  a ,Relevant
If it is not a civil engineering operation  is it an individual planning?  b  If it is a grid construction work that is needed  the file is sent to the technical solution officer,Relevant
 1  Planned works wait for the period defined in the order then check if there is a request for authorization or information,Relevant
 a  If it is an information request  planned works show the levelling zone and encodings to Powalco and then check KLIM and CICC and the process goes on,Relevant
If it is an authorization request  they check if the authorization has been received,Relevant
If it has been received  the process goes on  if it hasn t  planned works contact the competent authorities again to receive the authorization  then the process goes on,Relevant
Planned works then figure out if there s a presence of KLIM CICC,Relevant
If there is  the file is sent to the CTM coordinator  2  and planned works wait for the CTM coordinator s feedback,Relevant
When the feedback is received  the process goes on,Relevant
 *  If there is not a presence of KLIM CICC  planned works find out if it is an individual planning,Relevant
 b  If it is an individual planning  the process goes on,Relevant
If it is not an individual planning  they form the batches  transmit a list to the contractor and inform the client and the process goes on,Relevant
 c   *  Planned works then contact the client to arrange an appointment  they make the client aware of the preparatory work and then plan the appointment with them,Relevant
They send a confirmation email to the client,Relevant
If the reply received is negative  planned works contact the client again,Relevant
 c  If the reply is positive  planned works assess if the work is planned on a contractor,Relevant
If it is  planned works prepare the file that will be sent to the contractor and send it to him,Relevant
Then the process is done and a signal is sent to the process  Execute the work ,Relevant
If it is not  the file is sent to a technician and planned works assess if it is a civil engineering operation,Relevant
If it is not a civil engineering operation  the process is done and a signal is sent to the process  Execute the work ,Relevant
If it is a civil engineering operation  planned works send the file to the contractor to carry out civil engineering,Relevant
The process is then done and a signal is sent to the process  Execute the work ,Relevant
 1  When the technical solution officer gets the file  they get back the file s investment cronos and check the CTM,Relevant
If there is a CTM file  it is sent to the CTM coordinator  2  and the process goes on,Relevant
If there is not a CTM file  the process goes on,Relevant
The technical solution officer adjusts the file   d  asks for authorization  inform planned works of the theoretical period  * ,Relevant
The officer finally transfers the file to the supervisor and his part is over,Relevant
When the supervisor gets the file  he checks if the authorization is received,Relevant
If it is not received  the process goes back to the officer,Relevant
 d  If it is received  the supervisor executes the construction work  foresees the end of the work and informs the manager  which gets the info  then sends the file to the manager and the process is done,Relevant
The manager gets the file  foresees the end of the work  executes the operation work  informs planned works of the end of the works  *  and then the operation work is done,Relevant
 2  The CTM coordinator gets the file  contacts the other recipients  visits the work site  creates a report and sends the feedback to planned works,Relevant
He then informs the technician and the contractor and the CTM is managed,Relevant
The two main ORES services involved in the work execution process are the  planned works  department and the executing agent working in parallel,Irrelevant
Three other ORES actors play a lighter role  namely the  design office    supervision  and  local logistics manager ,Irrelevant
Executing agent  The process starts with the receipt of the file,Relevant
Then either civil engineering works are required or not,Relevant
If they are required  the agent plans them  informs the  planned works  of the civil engineering opening date  1   then carries out the inventory of fixtures  executes the earthworks and finally confirms the execution of the earthworks to the  planned works   2 ,Relevant
Otherwise  nothing happens,Relevant
After that  the executing agent tries to reach the client 15 minutes before his departure and then goes to his home,Relevant
If the client can be reached and is present  he carries out the inventory of fixtures,Relevant
If the client is not present at first  the agent tries to reach him but if he is still unreachable  the executing agent then leaves a calling card  calls the BOPW  encodes the mobile data and finally signs the report,Relevant
The Process ends in the management of the nonexecuted,Relevant
After the inventory of fixtures  the agent checks whether additional work at the client s request is necessary  if not he can directly check the certificate of conformity,Relevant
If any work is required  the agent looks whether he needs BOPW information,Relevant
If so  he will request it and wait for confirmation,Relevant
In case of refusal  he checks the certificate of conformity,Relevant
In case of confirmation or if BOPW information is not required  he informs the customer of the costs  asks for his agreement  carries out the work and finally checks the certificate of conformity,Relevant
After checking the certificate of conformity  he checks the power and then jointly measures the column and replaces the meter and the parameter,Relevant
In the event of a problem at the time of replacement or parameter setting  the agent informs the local logistics manager  3   if the problem concerns only one meter the operation is repeated  otherwise an electromechanical meter is installed  then the customer is informed and the agent answers any questions in the same way as if the parameter setting was carried out correctly,Relevant
After that  if the LED confirms the functionality,Relevant
Then the meter is switched on  otherwise it is left switched off,Relevant
Then  he draws up an inspection plan which he sends to the Ores drawing office  4   enters the connection and counting data  confirms the materials used  draws up the output inventory and has the customer sign the report,Relevant
If civil works are required  the agent plans the closure of the civil works  informs the  planned works  of the closure date  5   plugs up the holes  repairs in a definitive manner  makes the inventory of fixtures and finally confirms the completion of the repair to the  planned works   6 ,Relevant
Finally  his last task is to encode the internal services in the case of internal services or to encode the internal services in the case of entrepreneurial work,Relevant
The process ends by sending the file to the post administration,Relevant
Planned work  The process begins with the planning of the worksite,Relevant
Then  if civil engineering works are required  the  planned works  department receives the civil engineering opening date from the executing agent  1   the department then sends the civil engineering dates to the client  waits and finally receives confirmation of the earthworks by the executing agent  2 ,Relevant
If no civil engineering works are required  the  planned works  department informs the client by sms of the date of the works 48 hours in advance,Relevant
The department then receives the execution information,Relevant
If the execution is not carried out  the process ends and the  prepare for execution  process begins,Relevant
If it has been carried out  there is a waiting period,Relevant
Finally  again if civil works are required  the  planned works  department receives the civil works closing date from the executing agent  5   the department then sends the civil works closing dates to the client  waits  receives the confirmation of the civil works closing from the executing agent  6  and finally updates the data in the POWALCO software,Relevant
If there is no civil engineering  nothing happens,Relevant
The process is then completed towards post administration,Relevant
The drawing office  The process starts with the reception of the plan from the executing agent  4  and is then completed towards post administration,Relevant
Monitoring The process starts with the reception of the date of the works  then the service ensures the supervision of the building sites and the process is finished with supervised building sites,Relevant
Local logistics manager  The process starts with the reception of the message from the executing agent  3   then he processes the request and the process ends,Relevant
The process starts at planned works when a technical visit is needed,Relevant
If a visit without appointment  V1  is needed  planned works transfer the request to a technician and waits for feedback with the info concerning the V1,Relevant
While planned work is waiting  a technician gets the request  carries out the visit and transfers info to planned works before being done with V1,Relevant
When planned works get the V1 info  they can move on and prepare a file for a technical visit  V2 ,Relevant
If a V1 is not needed  planned works directly prepare a file for a technical visit,Relevant
Planned works then plan V2 with the client,Relevant
After  they send a request to agents to know their availability,Relevant
When the agents get the request  they process it taking into account geographical and technical skills and send back their availabilities to planned works,Relevant
After receiving the agents  availability  planned works confirm the appointment with the client and send the file to a technician,Relevant
They then wait for feedback while the technician gets the request  carries out a technical visit and sends their feedback,Relevant
When the feedback is received  planned works handle it and then assess if civil engineering is required,Relevant
If it is not required the processing is done,Relevant
Otherwise  the feedback is sent to the contractor and the processing is done,Relevant
The subscription process is facilitated by the digital transformation  in usual context the customer and the company are engaged into an endless mail exchange demanding the documents for the subscription,Irrelevant
Thanks to Flora a new client only needs to enter some information about his property and his insurance fee is automatically calculated using the dimension and the location of his property,Relevant
If the new client is not in the defaulters  database  there is no need for an employee to take part in the process  the contract and insurance details will be automatically digitally created and sent to the customer,Relevant
If the client is indeed in the defaulter s database  Flora needs to conduct a short investigation to determine if they accept the client or not before finishing the process following the classical way,Relevant
By using this process  customers are now able to modify their contract online  following a move for instance  by simply entering details about their new property,Irrelevant
Their new price is calculated in the same way as in the subscription process  and the rest is also similar  contract and insurance details will be automatically created and sent to the customers as well as the new contract start date,Irrelevant
Flora allows the customer to make this report via a chatbox within the mobile app in a few steps,Irrelevant
Of course after the declaration  an external contractor will come to your place to contact the damage but there is no need to extra paperwork that is usually used with the traditional way,Relevant
The following process is of high interest as switching insurance can be really difficult and require documents and long procedures from both the former and the new insurance company,Irrelevant
Noting that  this is actually a sub process of the subscription as most new clients are often covered before subscribing to Flora,Irrelevant
To complete the process  customers are invited to enter different information about their former contract such as the company and their contract number,Relevant
Then the resignation form is generated and signed online by clients using Itsme  Belgian Mobile ID initiative ,Relevant
The rest of the process is handled by Flora  which will deal with the former insurer and will send them the resignation form,Relevant
Once these tasks are completed  details about the former contract terms end date and the new contract start date are sent to customers,Relevant
At last  the new contract will automatically start at the end of the former one,Relevant
By using Flora  a procedure that can take several days for clients is now completed in a few minutes,Irrelevant
Filling a complaint is one of the most common processes inside an insurance company,Irrelevant
This is usually a very tedious process for the client but now thanks to the new channel of communication  it is much easier for the clients using the Flora s application in order to fill a complaint  this can be done in few minutes,Irrelevant
The prospection and commercial process is triggered by the sales engineers who study the requirements of the prospects potential clients,Relevant
Then the CEO COO elaborate sales strategy and set individual goals,Relevant
Sales Engineers receive requests for quotation from clients and afterwards they consider whether the project submitted by the customers is feasible for Alpha or not,Relevant
If not  the request is declined and the process is stopped,Relevant
But if the quotation is feasible  sales engineers work together with the help of R D engineers to make a technical and commercial offer and ask for client s agreement,Relevant
If the customer s answer is not favorable  then they try to know on which point they failed to interest the customer  and then the process is stopped,Relevant
But conversely if the customer s response is favorable then back office registers new client and its order in the ERP system,Relevant
The sales engineers compare the order with the quotation made at the customer  price  quantity  product description  delay  and after that  a contract is written by the CEO in collaboration with the sales engineer  with the possibility of having some negotiations with the customers on commercial terms,Relevant
If the order is compliant with the offer made  the back office checks the availability of the product and the production delay announced by the ERP system,Relevant
Otherwise  the continuity of the process goes back to the steps before  there are once again negotiations with the customers in order to find a common agreement ,Relevant
When these two tasks are completed  the back office confirms and validates the order to the client  and they register the complete order in the ERP system,Relevant
Once this last step is completed  the prospection and commercial process ends,Relevant
The R D process starts when a need is expressed,Relevant
Sales engineers and R D engineers formalize the request  describe the new product and evaluate the feasibility  cost  strategy coherence   in the early stages,Relevant
Then the CEO COO challenge their analyze and decide if the feasibility is conceivable  the project is stopped if it is not the case ,Relevant
Sales engineers and R D engineers check prototype scale feasibility   conduct tests,Relevant
If the project is technically validated by R D  the production engineers go on by checking industrial feasibility and preparing production file,Relevant
After that step  the Quality Manager certificates the product and requests client s approval by sending them the previous documents,Relevant
If the customer s feedback is good  the bill of materials is made and the current process ends  otherwise the engineers continue to improve the development plans and the process is repeated in the stages of carrying out tests and analyzing feasibility on a prototype scale,Relevant
The process starts when the engineers make the BOM  Bill of Materials  and send the file with the logistical needs defined by a color code,Relevant
Consequently  a need is expressed and registered in the ERP system,Relevant
The supply chain department looks at the BOM and then decides if it needs comparative quotes,Relevant
  If the purchase amount is estimated to be greater than 10000€  comparative quotes are needed,Relevant
In this case  the supply chain department searches suppliers  consults three of them and compare their offers,Relevant
Then  it chooses a supplier,Relevant
  If the purchase amount is estimated to be less than 10000€  the supply chain department does not need comparative quotes and directly selects a supplier,Relevant
After selecting a supplier  there are two options    If this is a new supplier  the specific team  composed by the COO  the head of the supply chain department and the quality manager  performs a supplier audit,Relevant
If the conclusions of this audit are not positive  the supply chain department selects another supplier,Relevant
If the audit is conclusive  the supply chain manager registers supplier s information in the ERP system and sends a notification to the supplier selected,Relevant
  If Alpha Innovations has already worked with this supplier  the specific team sends a notification to the supplier selected,Relevant
Afterwards  the supply chain department establishes the order and receives the material once the supplier has fulfilled the order,Relevant
In some case  a conformity certificate is required  because AISA works with railway companies  RATP for example  or nuclear sector where high level of traceability is mandatory,Relevant
#NAME?
  In some cases  the supply chain organizes quality control for incoming and finished goods and the warehouse clerk checks it,Relevant
Alpha Innovations controls most of the time the products  quality  except when it comes to checking small parts  like basic screws  etc ,Relevant
If the quality control shows material is defective  the supply chain gives the order to the warehouse clerk to return the product to the supplier,Relevant
If the quality control is good  the warehouse clerk stores the product and registers it in the ERP system,Relevant
Finally  the head of supply chain  the quality manager and the COO evaluate the supplier s performance  ask for corrective actions if the supplier is not performant enough  and then the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when the workshop manager receives the project from the R D department,Relevant
With the recommendations from the production engineer  he evaluates which and how many workers must be assigned to this project linked to the difficulty s level of the latter,Relevant
With the help of the supply chain manager  he checks when all the needed material  BOM  will be available in stock at the factory,Relevant
With all this information  he gives an approximation of the delivery date to the customer,Relevant
He receives a set of documents thanks to the ERP system which describes  the BOM  Bill of Materials   mechanical plans  electrical scheme  control prescription    everything that is needed to organize production of the project,Relevant
The supply chain department receives the document and launches a production order to the warehouse clerk who prepares and sends all the materials needed to the workshop,Relevant
At this stage  the workshop manager must prepare assembly aid documents which describe the production process adapted to the type of work to be executed,Relevant
The function of the workshop manager is also to describe the jobs of each technician involved,Relevant
Afterwards  technicians operate  first  they prepare nameplates to be able to identify all the products and cables,Relevant
Secondly  they assembly the systems while they identify themselves at each step of the process for the tracing and consequently the responsibility,Relevant
The workshop manager is responsible for describing the complexity of conformity control which is afterwards operate by the technicians,Relevant
At this stage  test technicians operate the FAI  First Article Inspection   they inspect the finished systems  to see if it is safe  functional and conform to the specifications,Relevant
If all tests are conclusive  the system is sent to the shipment employee who will package and send it to customers with the help of other actors  haulers    ,Relevant
The systems production process ends at the moment the system is submitted to the shipment employee,Relevant
The process is triggered when the product is received by the packaging employee who packages the product,Relevant
Then  two tasks are done in parallel  addition of a suitable ID label to the package and wedging and wrapping to protect the product,Relevant
The packaging employee makes the delivery form and send it to the head of shipment department who is going to give a pick list number and  afterwards  registers the pick list number on the ERP system,Relevant
Later on  the packaging employee fills the picklist with the product s information  weight  date     on the ERP system,Relevant
Subsequently  the employee stores the product in the shipment area,Relevant
After that  the head of shipment management received on the ERP system the picklist completed and then classify the picklist by due date until the delivery day,Relevant
When the delivery day has come  the back office does two tasks at the same time  to prepare the delivery note and print it and prepare the invoice and print it as well,Relevant
After that  the back office sends the documents to all services concerned via the ERP system  i e  accounting ,Relevant
Finally  the packaging employee add the waybill and the delivery note on the package and thereafter he gives the package to the haulers,Relevant
The process ends when the order is sent,Relevant
The process starts when IT equipment is needed by a service manager,Relevant
The request is first analyzed by the head of the IT Department and they have to decide if the request is justified or not,Relevant
If the request is not justified  the process ends,Relevant
If the request is justified  they also have to decide if they accept it or not  in some cases  the request is justified but the solution requested to this need seems to be inappropriate ,Relevant
If the request is not accepted  but stays justified obviously   the service manager has the opportunity to adapt the request and suggests a new request  that the head of IT Department will analyze again and the process starts again,Relevant
The service manager has also the choice to not adapt his request and the process ends in this case,Relevant
But if the request is accepted  then the head of IT department asks for a quote,Relevant
If it is the first time that the supplier works with the company  the purchasing department has to add this supplier in the suppliers evaluation form,Relevant
If the budget or treasury will be affected with this expense  the Chief Financial Officer has to analyze the expense and decides if he validates the expense or not,Relevant
If he does not validate it  then the head of the IT Department has to ask for a new quote to a new supplier,Relevant
If the expense is validated  the head of the IT Department completes the purchase form and then the purchasing department makes the order and sends it to the supplier,Relevant
When the order is ready  the supplier sends it with the purchase documents  that is to say the invoice and the acknowledgement of receipt  to the head of the IT department  who sends after all to the service manager,Relevant
Next  both the head of the IT department and the purchasing department compare the purchase order with the delivery and the invoice,Relevant
If one of them finds something incorrect  they contact the supplier in order to solve the problem and then compare it again and contact the supplier again until everything is in order,Relevant
When everything is correct or if everything was right the first time  the Chief Financial Officer has to validate the purchase,Relevant
If he does not validate it  the comparison process between the invoice  the purchase order and the delivery starts again until the amount to be spent aligns with their expectations,Relevant
If he validates the purchase  then he pays the invoice and the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when the need is notified by the receipt of a purchase order form by the service manager,Relevant
Then  the purchase department has to analyse the demand  if it is not ok  the demand is obviously rejected and the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise  they have to request a quote,Relevant
If the quote is asked to a new supplier  the purchasing department has to add it into the evaluation suppliers form  data base ,Relevant
Then  the financial management has to validate the quote  if it is not ok  the demand has to be analysed again but if it is financially ok  the service can be ordered so the service department asks for an intervention,Relevant
The supplier performs the requested service and sends the purchase documents  purchase order and invoice  afterwards,Relevant
Next  the purchasing department compares the purchase order with the invoice received and has to validate  if something is wrong  the invoice is not validated and the department contacts the supplier for another validation,Relevant
Otherwise  the financial department has to validate it a second time,Relevant
Again  if it is not ok  the purchase department has to compare it again but if it is ok  the financial department puts the invoice in payment and the process ends when the service provider is paid,Relevant
The process starts with the presentation of the candidate at the office,Relevant
He enrolls for the examination,Relevant
The centre manager checks the planning in the license database if the candidate is already planned,Relevant
If it is not the case  the centre has to create a new file for this candidate in the license database,Relevant
Then  he registers the candidate to the examination,Relevant
The applicant has to pay for his registration,Relevant
If the payment is not received  the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise  the process continues and the centre manager checks the validity of the candidate and guide s ID cards,Relevant
If those are invalid  the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
If  on the contrary  the ID cards are acceptable  the centre manager checks the age conditions,Relevant
If those are not fulfilled  the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise  the process continues and the centre checks that the ID card corresponds to the candidate,Relevant
If he notices a mismatch  the Chief examiner seizes his ID card and warns the authorities,Relevant
The candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
If it corresponds  the centre checks the temporary driving license and the certificate from the municipality,Relevant
If those are invalid  the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
If those are valid  there are 2 possibilities,Relevant
Either the applicant has learned by a driving school or by another guide,Relevant
This second case requires an additional step  the centre checks the guide driving license,Relevant
If his driving license is invalid  the process ends and the candidate is rejected,Relevant
If it is valid  the process keeps going,Relevant
This step is not necessary if the candidate has learnt by a driving school,Relevant
Next  the centre checks the vehicle documents,Relevant
If those are not valid  the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise  the process continues with the examiner who checks the vehicle state,Relevant
If he evaluates the car as defective  the candidate is rejected and the process ends,Relevant
On the contrary  if the vehicle is in good conditions  the centre manager makes a random selection of the examination track thanks to the IT system of the company and the candidate is allowed to take the examination,Relevant
The candidate is accepted and the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when the candidate arrives at the centre,Relevant
An employee of the centre completes the identity verification form at least every 25 candidates and checks the validity of the client s ID card  according to the regulation ,Relevant
If the ID card is not valid  the process ends and the client is refused,Relevant
If it is valid  the client s age is checked  once again according to the legislation,Relevant
If the candidate doesn t fulfil the age requirement  the process ends and he is refused,Relevant
In the case where the client fulfils the age requirement  the centre employee checks that the card corresponds to the candidate,Relevant
If the card is not corresponding to the candidate  the employee takes the ID card  warns the authorities and the process ends,Relevant
The client is thus refused because of failure and fraud,Relevant
If the card corresponds to the candidate  the centre employee checks the number of failures and the driving school certificate if necessary,Relevant
The employee then registers the candidate,Relevant
If a session is not available  the client asks the availability and or takes an appointment  then comes back to the beginning  arrival ,Relevant
If a session is available  he checks that the client is already in the database,Relevant
If the client isn t  the centre employee creates a new file in the Database Permis  ‘DB Permis  ,Relevant
If the client was already registered or has just been registered  the employee registers the candidates and checks his data,Relevant
After that the client has paid  the employee generates a session for the candidate  according to his category  from the ‘DB Permis  which generates a random series of questions,Relevant
The client takes the exam,Relevant
If a fraud is detected during the exam  the centre interrupts the exam and warns the authorities  the client is then refused  failure and fraud  and the process ends,Relevant
In each case  the results are printed by the centre,Relevant
If the exam is passed  the client takes the reading test  and the process ends with the delivery of the provisional driving licence  PCP   the results and some information,Relevant
If the exam is failed  the client is given the results of the exam,Relevant
The process starts when the candidate arrives at the examination centre,Relevant
There is a previous control of the vehicle by the examinator before he makes a random selection for the track with the IT system,Relevant
Then he takes note of the track and manoeuvres,Relevant
The customer makes the track and manoeuvres directed by the examinator  according to the traffic regulations ,Relevant
The examinator assesses the abilities of the candidate,Relevant
If he makes a dangerous manoeuvre  the exam is interrupted,Relevant
Otherwise the examinator makes a global assessment of the exam and he registers the assessments with the IT system,Relevant
He encodes the results and sends them to the server of the company  with the IT system and the protocol of the exam ,Relevant
Then he archives the protocol and at the same time  he gives the result to the candidate,Relevant
If the result is a success  the exam is passed but if it is a failure  the exam is failed,Relevant
The first step in the registration process is the quote calculation,Irrelevant
It begins when someone needs to obtain a tenant insurance,Relevant
The user will then take an interest in Flora and go to the website,Relevant
The customer will go on  découvrir mon prix  and so the quote calculation process begins,Relevant
The user is now on the page where he selects the type of housing,Relevant
It can be a house  2 or 3 faces   a villa  4 faces  or a flat,Irrelevant
Selecting an accommodation type enables the user to move forward to the next screen,Relevant
The user just has to click on the right button to go further  there is no  continue  button ,Relevant
Then the user has to enter his address to go further in the process,Relevant
When the user starts typing his address  a drop down list appears with all the street names corresponding to the entered characters,Relevant
In order to move forward  the user has to select one address in the Google results and the system moves on directly to the next page,Relevant
If the user enters an address abroad  the pop up window appears informing the user that Flora is only available in Belgium,Relevant
If the user lives in a zone subject to flooding  a pop up window also appears to say that the house is located in a zone subject to flooding and that the user cannot be insured for the moment  the user can be redirected to the Ethias website,Relevant
If the address is unknow   the message   Je ne trouve pas mon adresse   appears,Relevant
The user is redirected to the page where he has to enter manually his address  he has to complete manually all the fields,Relevant
If the address is known  located in Belgium and complete  the user clicks on  Confirmer  and is then redirected to the monthly rental amount page,Relevant
The monthly rental amount is a mandatory field,Irrelevant
If it is left empty  a warning red notice must ask the user to correctly fill it out  Max of characters  7 ,Relevant
If the user enters a higher rent  the pop up window appears informing the user that Flora doesn t insure properties with a rent higher than 1500€,Relevant
The user can decide to move on to the Ethias website or exit the Flora s quote calculation process by clicking on the X in the upper right hand corner   the button  Je comprends ,Relevant
The user then goes to the  Prix  page  which mentions the price of the rental insurance for his property at his address,Relevant
The price covers the civil liability and the content of the housing,Irrelevant
The user can choose to add or not add the vandalism cover,Relevant
To finish this process  the user has to tick the Checkbox of the terms conditions before being able to continue,Relevant
Once the quote calculation process is complete  a customer profile must be created,Irrelevant
This process starts with the screen  mon compte    the user must fill in different information  First name  name  date of birth  phone number  email address and password are mandatory fields,Relevant
Before going to the next step  the system makes a verification about the age of the user,Relevant
In fact  the user must be between eighteen and hundred years old because they consider that outside this age slice  you are less likely to take out insurance,Irrelevant
So  if the customer is under eighteen or over hundred  the process stops  and the customer gets stuck,Relevant
The next step consists in checking if the email address still exists in the system because it is possible to have a user who has given the account creation just after entering the personal information  or who has left the process for a moment perhaps to pick up where he left off later on,Relevant
So  if the email address did not still exist  Flora will then send an email to the user in order to allow him to validate his email address,Relevant
In the email  the user can push on a button  Valider mon compte  or on another  Je n ai pas demandé de compte Flora ,Relevant
If the email address still existed  we can go on the next step,Relevant
After that  Flora has to check if the email address is still validated,Relevant
If it is the case  the account is created and it s the final event,Relevant
If the user did not confirm his email address and pushed on button  Je n ai pas demandé de compte Flora   the process stops  and no account will be created for the user,Relevant
Just in order to precise a little  at the end of this business process  the user is still not a customer  he is a prospect,Irrelevant
He will become a customer once he will be logged into the application as such,Irrelevant
This step of the process is important because it will be impossible for the user to use the app as long as he is not a real client,Irrelevant
Indeed  he will be considered as a prospective customer until the moment he makes the payment,Irrelevant
Without this payment  even if the user created an account  he is not allowed to gain access to the application,Irrelevant
The first stage consists in asking the client information about his moving in the housing,Relevant
On the one hand  if he already moved in  Flora will invite the client to state if he is insured for this housing or not,Relevant
In case of a client who is already insured  Flora will ask the user to enter the contact details of his previous insurer and we will deal with the termination of his contract,Relevant
On the other hand  if the user has not moved in yet  the app will request him to enter the date of moving in and his future address,Relevant
After that  he will be invited to choose a payment method,Relevant
The client will soon be allowed to choose among three different means of payment   with a credit card  via PayPal or via Apple Pay,Relevant
For the moment  there are only two payment methods available   the credit card and PayPal,Irrelevant
By selecting the credit card as mean of payment  the user will be redirected to the next screen,Relevant
At that point  he will have to encode his card number  the name of the card  the validity date and the CVV number,Relevant
Obviously  there will be no direct debit before the start of the contract,Irrelevant
In the case where the user would want to pay with PayPal  he would be redirected to the PayPal interface in order to check that the available balance on PayPal is sufficient to pay,Relevant
Then  the user can click on the button  Suivant  which will redirect him to another screen with a summary of his contract   type of housing  monthly rental amount  full address  contract duration  price  credit card registered and so on,Relevant
After having checked the elements of his contract  he must accept the general terms conditions before subscribing to the product and paying,Relevant
Then  he can click on  Confirmer  and in that case  it means that the user wants to confirm and pay,Relevant
Once the contract is confirmed  the client will be invited to download the application in order to handle his insurance directly from the application,Relevant
From the moment he confirmed  the contract is forward to him by email,Relevant
Finally  at this step of the process  the client receives a confirmation email with the documents related to the contract attached,Relevant
If he receives this email  it means that the payment is accepted and therefore  the contract is confirmed,Relevant
From a legal point of view  it is mandatory to send a confirmation email to the policyholder,Irrelevant
From that moment  the client can log in into his account  access his profile and his documents  ask questions  manage decisions and request a refund in the event of a damage,Irrelevant
First of all  when the client wants to create a new claim  he needs to open the chat bot in the app,Relevant
The date of the damage will be requested from the customer to verify if he was covered by insurance at the time of the damage,Relevant
If this is not the case  the client will not be compensated,Relevant
Then  the client will receive a reduced list of the frequent damage and will be asked to select the damage concerned,Relevant
If the damage is not in this list  then it may be part of the list of damages not covered and  in this case  the customer will not be compensated,Relevant
Or the client may request to be put in contact with the CCM  customer communication management ,Relevant
However  if the damage has been found on the list  the process continues normally,Relevant
The client will then be asked whether or not it was a personal property,Relevant
If it is  then the client will give more information about the asset,Relevant
And if it is not  the process continues to the next step,Relevant
In that step  the client will have the opportunity to report another claim  if this is the case  the client will be sent back to the beginning of the process in order to give all the necessary information again,Relevant
If there is no further damage to report  then the customer will be asked for the owner s contact information,Relevant
Afterwards  the application will ask the customer if there is at least one property that belongs to the owner,Relevant
In both cases a summary adapted to the situation will be sent to the customer,Relevant
Finally  if the customer wishes to conclude and send the notification of the damages  he will have to click on  Envoyer   the damage will be transferred and the case will be finished,Relevant
Once the damage has been notified and that the claim has been transferred to  Ma demande   it will be transferred to the customer manager,Relevant
He will then process the claim  starting by judging whether or not it is important,Relevant
If the claim is significant  he will call in an expert to determine the amount of compensation,Relevant
Otherwise  he will define the amount himself on the basis of the information provided by the customer in the Flora application,Relevant
It is possible that the customer manager may not have the necessary information to calculate the refund,Relevant
In this case  he will send an e mail to the customer to request the missing information,Relevant
Once the amount of compensation has been determined  the customer manager will enter it into the application,Relevant
Then  if this amount is higher than 1000 euro  the Flora application must approve the compensation request before sending it to the customer,Relevant
If Flora detects a flaw  it will inform the customer manager who will re analyse the situation,Relevant
Otherwise  if Flora approves the request for compensation or in the event that the amount is less than 100 euro  the compensation proposal will be sent to the customer,Relevant
The next step depends on the client s approval of the compensation proposal,Irrelevant
If the customer approves  Flora will ask for the customer s bank account number and an electronic signature via ITSME,Relevant
Once the compensation proposal has been signed  the client will be reimbursed and will receive a notification that the file has been closed,Relevant
The client receives the compensation amount on his bank account and the process is thus completed,Relevant
If  on the other hand  the customer does not approve the compensation proposal  Flora will forward this refusal to the customer manager,Relevant
The acquisition of lands and buildings process by Spi follows a certain chain of events  decisions and actions,Irrelevant
First of all  they start by asking the government procurement if there is any land or buildings available,Relevant
In order to do this  they send a letter expressing their wish,Relevant
If there are no lands or buildings available  they express to the government procurement that they are aiming to buy  so they fill in a form to be added to the waiting list and they will be notified when an opportunity comes along,Relevant
If something is available  the procedure usually begins with an estimation of the property solicited by the government procurement,Relevant
Then  this estimation is reported to Spi,Relevant
Since Spi is aiming to rent or sell these acquisitions  before they buy lands and buildings  they need to be sure that they will bring interests to their clients,Relevant
So  they decide to carry out a market research and see if the assets are interesting enough,Relevant
If it is not interesting  they decide to drop off,Relevant
If it is interesting  then Spi asks their experts to carry out their own estimation of the asset,Relevant
If the estimation matches  they carry out the next step otherwise the company and the government procurement try to reach an agreement,Relevant
Without any agreement found  the company can decide to end the acquisition process,Relevant
After they agree on a price  Spi asks the bank if they are allowed to have a loan,Relevant
To do so  the financial department provides the bank with the expertise and the result of the market research,Relevant
Then  they have to wait 10 days to have a decision from the banker,Relevant
If after 10 days they don t have an answer  they can reschedule an appointment to have the final decision  usually if they don t have an answer after 10 days  it s because the loan has been rejected so during this second meeting  they will try to find a new arrangement ,Relevant
If no arrangement has been found  the process ends here,Relevant
The commercialization of plots of lands and building starts when Spi receives by email the interest of a client to buy a building or a plot of land,Relevant
Then  it has to acknowledge confirm the receipt in order to follow the sale,Relevant
Once  the receipt acknowledges  Spi has a free two month reservation to send a form to the candidate buyer,Relevant
This one fills out the request and sends it back to the company which has the duty to complete  sign and date the form,Relevant
Once  this first step done  Spi  executive board has one month to take a decision about the sale of its plots of land or building,Relevant
The agreement between these two parts remain valid for a period of six months,Relevant
Then  the company gives an agreement in principle to formalize the contract and the sales otherwise  if the candidate buyer doesn t respect this six month validity  Spi cancels the contract and the client is obliged to give 10% of the sum of the land or the building to the company  e g  when the client doesn t want to buy the land anymore before the 6 months ,Relevant
When the six months are respected  Spi will receive the 10% of the value of the land by the candidate buyer and it has to sign the deed,Relevant
Later  Spi checks if the payment is correct and if the reservation fee has been paid in one month,Relevant
Then  if all is done in the rules  Spi orders the measuring plan and the placement of markers on the sold property,Relevant
The reception of the proof credit from a bank by Spi leads to the selling of the land,Relevant
Otherwise  if the reservation fee is not received in one month  the order is rejected,Relevant
The Head of the rental department receives a request concerning the rental of a building,Relevant
He sends the request to the legal department  they check whether the request is complete and legal,Relevant
If the document is not complete  the client gets a message saying that he has to complete his documents,Relevant
If the document is complete  the head of the rental department schedules a meeting with the client,Relevant
During this meeting the client proposes a price,Relevant
If the price is too low the head of the department does a counterproposal  which is then accepted or not by the client,Relevant
When the client refuses  the negotiations are over and we consider the process done,Relevant
When a correct deal has been reached by the 2 parties  we draft a contract,Relevant
When the contract is signed the process has reached its end,Relevant
The appeal for intervention process in which the trigger event is the need for services such as reparations  gardening   Once the problem is identified  the maintenance department looks for companies with qualified people who could fill this need and then get in touch with that company,Relevant
They explain the need or issue,Relevant
If this person is indeed qualified for this request  a quote is asked,Relevant
When the quote from the company is received  the maintenance department examines it,Relevant
If it seems correct  they send it to the financial department which determines if it fits the company s budget in order to submit their agreement or not,Relevant
If they do agree  the maintenance department contacts the company again to complete the final terms and sign a contract,Relevant
Otherwise  they explain to the company that they do not want to go any further and restart the search for qualified people,Relevant
Once both parties have signed the contract  the financial department proceeds with the payment,Relevant
Finally  the maintenance department checks the service delivery to be sure that it is well done and that it meets their expectations,Relevant
The data analysis process is done in several steps  First  data analysts collect data from different sources for every sector,Relevant
Then  they merge the data from different sources and make a relation between them  unnecessary data is cleaned in order to concentrate on the economic analysis,Relevant
Data analysts analyze the evolution of the annual revenue of the companies for each sector and they combine the data of SPI with the one coming from the outside sources,Relevant
Finally  the results are interpreted  and the analysts make the best economic analysis possible and come to a conclusion,Relevant
The report of the analysis is then published in the database of the company  so that it is accessible to everyone,Relevant
Everything starts when a student is positive for the COVID 19,Relevant
The school will receive the information via email  phone or even via SMS,Relevant
Whether it s via phone  the school management will ask some specific questions such as   what was the last day in class  when did the student do the test  when did the student receive the results and so on,Relevant
Then they will fulfil the file with their own information such as the place where the student is sitting in class  the schedule from each class    To do so  they must dispose of the class plans,Relevant
Moreover  it should be done regarding one clear and precise model,Irrelevant
Once the file is completed  they can start analysing the information,Relevant
The first and the most important one is to know who the students with high risks are,Relevant
For that  they will consult the class plans and will make groups of students   those who are behind the positive student are not impacted  nevertheless those who are on both sides from this student are risky only if they have had close contact with the positive student without masks,Relevant
Unfortunately  this operation is hard  because of option courses,Irrelevant
Indeed  there are a lot of different class plans for these courses meaning that students are not always sitting next to the same students depending on the courses,Irrelevant
Once every single information has been collected  they will send the complete file to the Safety Advisor via email,Relevant
When she receives the email  she will make a first analysis then she will either transfer the file to the PSE  the School Medicine  or just will share the information that there is one more positive student in the school in order to receive a solution to implement,Relevant
However  if it is an urgent situation the school management will take the decision to close a class without consulting the PSE,Relevant
In the normal process  the PSE will analyse the sent file and will send instructions to the Safety Advisor who will send them to the school management,Relevant
On the one hand  students with high risks will receive a mail with the procedure to apply and a coming back date,Relevant
On the other hand  students with no risks will receive a small mail to be aware of the positive student,Relevant
If it is possible  one or two members of the school management will go to the concerned class to give some extra information about the s positive student and answer some questions,Relevant
If the class is closed  the school management will send another email to specify it,Relevant
Then they will phone each parent,Relevant
After that  each excluded student will receive work on the LMS platform and thereby a coming back date,Relevant
The process begins when a teacher is absent,Relevant
If the teacher is absent for more than 3 months  at least 15 weeks   then they have to hire a  priority temporary   that is a teacher who has already given lessons either in the school or in a group of schools attached to the school for at least 360 days  accumulated  not necessarily in the same school ,Relevant
In this case  the management looks in its database for a priority temporary,Relevant
If there is a priority temporary in the database  they contact him her by phone,Relevant
Finally  a management member sends the schedule of the teacher to be replaced to the substitute teacher and the teacher is replaced,Relevant
If the teacher is absent for less than a day  then he is not replaced,Relevant
However  if he she is absent for more than a day  then a substitute teacher must be found,Relevant
To find a substitute teacher  there are two possible ways  either the candidate has sent his her CV  printed and classified in a folder in order of importance of the title   or via the website  Primoweb   on which we will be able to go do a search according to the teacher you want to hire,Relevant
Management will be able to enter a series of criteria  such as the duration of the exercise  the branch of expertise and so on,Relevant
Then  after pushing on the search button  they can see the number of titles required  of sufficient titles and of shortage titles,Relevant
In the case of application by CV  the candidate selection sub process begins when the file containing the applications is opened  If there are required titles available  then these are directly selected,Relevant
Otherwise  we go to sufficient titles,Relevant
If there is no sufficient title  we move on to shortage titles,Relevant
If there is no shortage title  we move on to unlisted shortage titles,Relevant
In the case of a candidate who has none of these titles  it would be considered an error in the system  and the process would end,Relevant
Then  the CV is downloaded by all members of the management,Relevant
In the case of  Primoweb   we will first choose the required titles  then the sufficient titles  and then the shortage titles  the unlisted shortage titles are not listed on  Primoweb  ,Relevant
Then we send an email to the candidate,Relevant
If he she accepts  his CV is downloaded by all members of the management,Relevant
If he she refuses  then the management goes back to  Primoweb   and looks for another replacement  again in order of degree of importance,Relevant
If he she does not respond within 3 days  the management returns to  Primoweb   and searches for another replacement  always in order of degree of importance,Relevant
This process can sometimes take a very long time,Irrelevant
After downloading the candidate s CV  the members of the management will judge whether it is interesting or not,Relevant
If it s not interesting  that ends the process and the candidate is rejected,Relevant
If the CV is interesting  we are faced with 2 situations,Relevant
If the situation is urgent  for example when a teacher falls ill  then the substitute teacher is directly contacted by telephone to replace the absent teacher,Relevant
If the situation is not urgent  or at least foreseeable  for example in the case of a work stoppage related to pregnancy  then they will send an email to the candidate to prepare an interview,Relevant
The management team will then do the interview,Relevant
If the interview is successful  a member of the management phones the candidate to confirm the replacement of the teacher,Relevant
If the interview is not good  the candidate is rejected,Relevant
After calling the candidate  they usually send the schedule of the teacher to be replaced,Relevant
The process starts when the teacher wants to do an excursion with his students,Relevant
Once the teacher has found an excursion  he she has to download an excursion document located on the digital workspace of the school in order to complete the first point of the document,Relevant
Then he she has to send that document to the school management where they will check for the validity of the document,Relevant
If the document is not valid the process comes to an end and the excursion will not take place,Relevant
If the document is valid the school management has to decide if they want to let the teacher carry out the excursion or not,Relevant
If they decide to not give the permission to execute the excursion the process comes to an end,Relevant
If they decide to let the teacher do the excursion  they have to sign the document and send it to the accountant,Relevant
The accountant will then evaluate the price of the excursion and he she will inform the teacher,Relevant
The teacher will then inform the parents of the excursion and give them all the necessary information such as the location  the price  the date  and some general information about it,Relevant
After that  the teacher has to wait for the parents  decision to either let go or not their child on the excursion,Relevant
Once the teacher has received the parents  decision he she will book the excursion and carry it out,Relevant
Once the excursion is done the teacher has to complete the rest of the excursion document and to send it to the accountant,Relevant
The accountant will then complete the document with other necessary documents such as the invoice and he she will also mention the fees of the excursion in the periodic settlement of the students so that the fees will be added to what the parents have to pay at the end of the period,Relevant
After that the document is archived and the process is completed,Relevant
Because of the covid crisis  Sainte Véronique had to modify their organisation of parents  meeting process,Irrelevant
Indeed  parents cannot enter the school anymore,Irrelevant
The school tried the new process out in June last year and they improved it for this year,Irrelevant
The process starts when report cards are encoded in the specific software used by the school,Relevant
The student s report is then received by his or her parents,Relevant
In the report card  there is a comment section in which parents can find the teachers the school wants them to meet,Irrelevant
An online form is created on the LMS and sent to the parents for each year,Relevant
The questions are the following   first name and last name of the student  class  name of the person filling the form  phone number of this person  a multiple choice question with three time intervals and who are the three teachers the parents want to meet,Irrelevant
Once the due date to fill in the form is reached  the form is closed by the IT manager,Relevant
The form is exported in an Excel format and the table is shared with the teachers on the LMS,Relevant
The table is posted on the right year group,Relevant
Teachers can download the document and check whether the parents who were asked to meet them are on the list,Relevant
If they are not on the list the teacher has to add them,Relevant
Once it is done  the teacher can schedule the phone calls,Relevant
If needed  the school can provide some phones and a room for teachers to call the parents,Relevant
If during the parents  meeting the teachers notices an exceptional situation  he or she has to notify the school management,Relevant
The school management will then handle the case depending on the situation,Relevant
Every new year  Collège Sainte Véronique opens its enrolment process  which consists of registering first year students for the following academic year,Relevant
Before entering the heart of the process  the school has to achieve some optional or mandatory activities in order to prepare the enrolment period,Relevant
The mandatory one is to communicate the school capacity for first year students as well as the number of classes in the different sections  general path  immersion path ,Relevant
For the optional ones  on the one hand  they have the possibility to enter into partnerships with other institutions to facilitate the movement of students from one school to another,Relevant
On the other hand  a first contact may be organized,Relevant
Then  from February 10 th   the first enrollment phase starts and pupils can hand over their application form to the school,Relevant
Of course  the school must check if the application form is correct and well filled,Relevant
If it is not the case the application is refused and cancelled,Relevant
Next  we need to distinguish the first and the second enrolment phase because applications will not be handled in the same way,Relevant
Registration requests must therefore be allocated to the period corresponding to them,Relevant
The first phase begins on February 10 and ends on March 7  while the second phase is opened from April 27 to August 24,Relevant
First registration phase Each application for registration must first be registered and then updated in the register  which in most cases takes the form of a database,Relevant
In each application form there are two sections that have to be completed by parents,Irrelevant
The general part has to be hand written  but for the confidential part  parents have the choice to fill it online or in paper format,Relevant
If the parents choose the paper format  the school is responsible for mailing the confidential section to CIRI,Relevant
Otherwise  with the online form  the form is directly transmitted to CIRI,Relevant
Finally  the school sends a confirmation mail to say that the application has been handled correctly,Relevant
Once March 7 is reached  the school closes the first registration phase,Relevant
If there are more registrations than available places  pupils will be ranked according to different criteria by CIRI,Relevant
The ranking is used to attribute places to top ranked pupils,Relevant
The ranking and the result of the selection has to be sent to the pupil and parents,Relevant
If the pupil has been selected a registration certificate is created,Relevant
Else  the pupil is put on the waiting list,Relevant
If there were not more registrations than available places  a registration certificate is immediately created,Relevant
Second registration phase As for the first phase  the school has to register each application and update the register book,Relevant
However  it is not necessary to send the confidential section to CIRI because this part is used to make the ranking,Relevant
After that  either the school is already complete and the pupil has to be put on the waiting list  or there are still places left and a registration certificate can be immediately created for the pupil,Relevant
A student in phase 2 will not be given priority over a student in phase 1 in the waiting list,Relevant
From now the two phases can be gathered in one common path,Relevant
On the side of students who received a certificate of registration  the school has to request that the pupil provides his CEB,Relevant
If the CEB is received before September 1  the process carries on,Relevant
Else  the application will be rejected and a certified refusal letter with return receipt requested will be sent,Relevant
Then  at the start of the school year  attendance will be taken and if the pupil is not present  he will have to justify his non attendance within 8 days  otherwise he will be expelled,Relevant
On the side of students who are on the waiting list  they have to wait until a place becomes available,Relevant
If it is the case  the school will inform the pupil of the situation and will ask him whether he wants to take the place or not,Relevant
If so  then a registration certificate will be written  and the process will follow the normal path described earlier,Relevant
If the student refuses the place  then his application will be cancelled,Relevant
A student on the waiting list can also cancel his or her application by sending a message to the school,Relevant
And lastly the waiting list is closed on August 24  which means that all students still on it will receive a certificate of refusal,Relevant
The recruitment is dealt with by the administrator  Pierre Girretz  himself,Irrelevant
Indeed  as mentioned before  the company does not have an HR department nor a  true  recruitment system established since the administrator can easily do this type of work himself,Irrelevant
This process is triggered only when a new post is available  and it is done in a more or less informal but also classical way  he receives applications and reads the CVs  then Mr,Relevant
Girretz first checks if the applicant has the competencies required for the job  degree  experience    ,Relevant
If the resume does not correspond to what is expected  then the application is rejected by email with a thank you for sending the CV,Relevant
If the candidate seems to have the right competencies on paper  then he receives a notification to fix a date for an interview,Relevant
Right after the interview  the administrator evaluates the candidate on his personality,Relevant
Indeed  Mr  Girretz puts a lot of importance on his  gut feeling ,Irrelevant
So if the personality matches  then the candidate is given a trial period to see the quality of his work  see if he can work with the team  and to check if the person understands what the company needs and if he will be involved in the future,Relevant
If the candidate does not fulfill these characteristics  then his application is rejected after the trial period,Relevant
Otherwise  if the administrator is happy with his work  he scans the person s ID and bank cards and they both sign the hiring document given by Securex and finally  the applicant is officially hired after declaring the recruitment to the Dimona,Relevant
This process consists of the reception of the different supplies needed to build the pellet stoves,Irrelevant
First  the supplier receives a notification with the item Sûti needs  then they prepare the order and notifies the company when it is ready to be sent,Relevant
When the items are received  the head of the production checks their quality by following the production quality sheet s instructions and ticks the boxes corresponding,Relevant
If their quality is ok  then the item s QR codes are scanned to be registered on the system and then each item is placed at the post where it will be needed to build the stoves,Relevant
In other words  the head of the production paves the way for the  order preparation process ,Irrelevant
However  if the items are defective  then a letter is written to explain the problem to the supplier  and the supplies are sent back to receive better ones,Relevant
When a client wants to buy a stove  he needs to request a quote on Sûti s website and to choose from a list of characteristics his dream pellet stove,Relevant
Then  when the company receives it  assuming every item is in stock  the order preparation process can begin,Relevant
Employees working in the production line start by identifying the type of stove the client wishes to order  they write down the model  the power of the stove  optional features     and they also transfer the quote to the reseller  since he will be the one in charge of providing the final product to the customer,Relevant
After that  the production line checks if the items needed for assembly are in stock,Relevant
If not  an order request is sent to the supplier to receive the missing supplies,Relevant
When every item is in stock  employees search for pieces  emplacement in the system thanks to the QR code they scanned when they first received the items,Relevant
Then  the actual assembly can start  the goods go from post to post  the stove is built little by little at every step,Relevant
Once it reaches post number N  the number of posts depending on each case  the final product is fully built and is ready to go through a quality check,Relevant
Once this quality check process is done  the pellet stove is packaged in a plastic cover and a wood box,Relevant
Finally  it can be shipped to the reseller store  which will be in charge of selling the stove to the customer,Relevant
This process is basically about testing the stove from A to Z  looking for leaks  checking for malfunctions  and so on,Irrelevant
The quality check is once again done in the production line,Irrelevant
The process starts when a stove is done being assembled and ends when it is operational and can be sent to the reseller,Relevant
In the first step  the employees fill in the production quality sheet by first writing down the stove s info like the guaranteed number  the model  its options  the customer s details  and so on,Relevant
Next  the stove s components are checked and tested by following the sheet s instructions,Relevant
They then turn the engine on to check it works perfectly and that there is no leak or any other problem as said previously,Relevant
If there is an issue  then workers use the QR code system we talked about earlier to find which pieces are missing or misplaced in the stove and fix them,Relevant
When they are sure the stove is working well  they can start to suck potential dirt and clean the whole stove,Relevant
Once both are done  they stick an A   label and a CE  European Conformity  label on the door of the engine,Relevant
After that  the rest of the quality sheet has to be filled up,Relevant
Then an instruction sheet  a plan of the stove  and a list of the items are added to the packaging of the pellet stove,Relevant
In the end  the product is fully operational and is ready to leave the company,Relevant
The after sales process begins when a client needs professional intervention,Relevant
When the client wishes to do its stove s annual maintenance  a qualified operator is sent to its home,Relevant
In that case  it is not Sûti who is responsible for that operation  but the stoves reseller store  depending on the localization  stores in Belgium  France  Switzerland   ,Relevant
So Sûti s employees will not take care of the maintenance  but rather an external professional who has conducted one of Sûti s training or a mechanic who has Sûti s approval to operate on its stoves will do it,Relevant
If the client needs an intervention because its stove has a technical problem  then it contacts Sûti,Relevant
The administrator  the chief technician  and the head of the production can all take care of the process indifferently,Irrelevant
When the company is notified  it then fills in the after sales form by  between others  selecting the stove type and its features  the MAC   IP addresses of the stove  the type of service it needs  and by writing the customer s and the reseller s contact information,Relevant
If the stove needs a physical intervention because it cannot be dealt with remotely  then the problem is handed over to MILLE Services  a subsidiary company,Relevant
After receiving information on the problem  this company will then send one of its technicians to repair the stove  then the after sales form will be signed by both the customer and MILLE Services,Relevant
Otherwise  if physical intervention is not necessary  which is mostly the case  then Sûti will solve the problem remotely through the internet thanks to the app it recently developed,Relevant
So first  they will use this app to detect the problem on the stove  then they will change the engine s parameters through the remote control system and will fill in the sheet with every problem encountered while doing so,Relevant
When they are done  they check if the stove is operational,Relevant
If so  the after sales document is signed and the process is over,Relevant
If not  then the stove will need a supplementary intervention physically  thus Sûti contacts MILLE Services and the service is handed to them as stated previously,Relevant
This process begins with the registration of the quotation,Relevant
When the welder load is planned  he will assign a design engineer to the project,Relevant
First of all  the planner will plan the welder load,Relevant
After that  several things will be made simultaneously,Relevant
  On the one hand  the quality manager will design the quality plan,Relevant
  On the other hand  the design engineer will first analyze the file in order to be able to draw the nomenclature of the project,Relevant
After that  the welding engineer will give the soudage instructions,Relevant
Then the process will continue with the calculation engineer who will make the calculation,Relevant
When these two simultaneous parts of the process will be covered  the pawn can move on to the resolution of questions task  executed by the design engineer,Relevant
When all the questions will be covered  it is the task of the project manager to validate the project,Relevant
Now  it will be up to the client to look at the drawing to approbate it in order to launch the creation of the project,Relevant
If the customer has other questions  he will send an email to the company to disapprove the drawing,Relevant
The design engineer will be obliged to do the task of questions resolution again,Relevant
If the customer approves the drawing  the company will receive an email from him,Relevant
After having received the customer approbation  the company will purchase its raw materials,Relevant
The project will then be sent to the workshop,Relevant
Two sub processes will then be required simultaneously,Relevant
The production traceability and the inspection,Relevant
After that  the calculation note will be drafted by the calculation engineer and the welding book by the welding engineer,Relevant
The plan  as built  will then be drawn,Relevant
The process ends with the expedition,Relevant
It is important to know that Into this process  each thing that will be associated with creation or assignment will be included in the ERP in the file created in the quotation registration,Irrelevant
The process begins when the purchasing department receives a purchase need,Relevant
They will first analyze the request,Relevant
Then  they will check if an authorized provider exists,Relevant
In fact  they must have to work with suppliers accepted by Ortmans in order to be certain of the quality of the service,Irrelevant
If a valid supplier exists for the requirement then we send him a request for quotation If this is not the case  the quality assurance manager will seek out a new supplier and evaluate it,Relevant
Once this is done  we can send the request for a quote,Relevant
When the purchasing department receives the quote  it is analyzed and then an order is sent to the supplier,Relevant
Once the order is received by the storekeeper  he will check the quantity received via the shipping document,Relevant
If a control card exists  then a quality controller must inspect the delivery qualitatively,Relevant
Then the conformity is checked via the ERP by the storekeeper,Relevant
If the order is compliant then it synchronizes the receipt of the order in the ERP and the purchase is complete,Relevant
If the order is non compliant  then the quality assurance manager will initiate a process to manage non compliance,Relevant
Once this is completed  the storekeeper can synchronize the receipt of the order in the ERP and the purchase will be completed,Relevant
At another time  the billing department will receive the invoice of the order  which will start their process,Relevant
This will be checked in the ERP,Relevant
Once the service is notified that the receipt of the order has been synchronized in the ERP  it can proceed to the payment and the payment will be completed,Relevant
The improvement action process starts with an improvement demand based on different sources  internal or external audit report  management review  customer complaint  non compliance  suggestion etc,Relevant
The request is then registered in the Excel table by the Quality Assurance Manager  Q A M  ,Relevant
This excel file will be used all along the process,Irrelevant
It is important to detect the issue  which means that an analysis of the problem in order to know the ins and outs of each approach will be conducted by the Q A M,Relevant
Then the Q A M  will conduct a criticality analysis in order to put the necessary resources on the actions that require it,Relevant
A corresponding amelioration file will be created in the excel table,Relevant
It will help in the choice of whether or not to initiate an improvement action,Irrelevant
When the amelioration file is finished  the Q A M will be able to analyse the issue properly,Relevant
If there is no improvement needed  the Q A M will answer to the improvement demand applicant with  if possible  an explanation for the refusal,Relevant
However  if an improvement is needed  the Q A M will determine the action with a reasonable timeframe and a person responsible for the action,Relevant
Those elements will also be added to the excel file,Relevant
When the action and those who are in charge of it are defined  the Q A M will inform the direction,Relevant
When the direction is informed of the issue  she provides the necessary means  and then launches the action,Relevant
The Implementation of the improvement action is then carried out by the action responsible,Relevant
In parallel  the Q A M follows up this implementation of the improvement action,Relevant
When the improvement action is finished  the Q A M  checks the effectiveness of the action implemented  i e  checking that the action focuses on the causes and not only on the consequences,Relevant
If the result is satisfying  the improvement action process ends there,Relevant
Otherwise  the criticality analysis must be reseen and the process starts again from this point,Relevant
The process starts when an unconformity is detected,Relevant
A non conformity must be declared when one or more of the following conditions are met ,Irrelevant
  Immediate repair at no significant cost is not possible,Irrelevant
  Immediate repair at low cost is possible but the problem is recurrent,Irrelevant
  Immediate low cost repair is possible but can lead to an opportunity for improvement,Irrelevant
   Supplier  defect  which includes not only raw material suppliers but also service providers and subcontractors ,Irrelevant
  Customer complaint is the subject of a complaint and therefore a  complaint  sheet is completed and if necessary  a  non conformity  sheet is completed,Irrelevant
The initials of the initiator with the date are added on the sticker who must be created to mark the non conformity,Relevant
Next  they have to fill in the non conformity sheets so that they do not have to search for information that is known to the initiator,Relevant
The NCS is transmitted to the QAM who is responsible for its follow up,Relevant
Record in Excel file for follow up,Relevant
The QAM communicates the NCS to the PM  Project manager ,Relevant
The person who is responsible for the non compliance is the quality manager,Irrelevant
This is the quality manager who makes a proposal for action at the project manager,Relevant
It is the PM who makes the decision whether or not to accept this proposal for action,Relevant
If the answer is no  the quality manager must make another proposal for action,Relevant
If it is approved  the project manager notifies the client and waits to receive the formal acceptance of the client,Relevant
If the client doesn t accept  it is up to the quality manager to remake another proposal action,Relevant
Both QAM and the quality manager must decide for verifications to do if the client accepts the proposal action,Relevant
Now it is up to the quality manager to make improvement actions and verify these actions back,Relevant
He will close the NCS  remove the marking  non conformity  and notify the QAM who shall verify the process  make analysis,Relevant
After the analysis  if he decides that other improvement actions must be taken  they will make a new one,Relevant
If not  they will archive the non conformity,Relevant
The process starts when a client needs new equipment and asks the company for a quotation,Relevant
The project manager receives the request and analyzes it in terms of solvency of the client and in terms of capacity of the company to produce the client s equipment,Relevant
An acknowledgment of receipt is sent to the client,Relevant
The project manager asks the management for an approval and  depending what the management will decide  the client s request will be approved or not,Relevant
If the request is rejected  the project manager will send a rejection to the client  otherwise  the process continues  and the project s file is created with an ERP s number,Relevant
Then  the design office makes an analysis of the different technical aspects and a quotation request is sent to the supplier,Relevant
Finally  with all the information received  the project manager makes the quote  and then  asks the management for some advice about the quote,Relevant
Afterward  the project manager establishes the offer  which is registered in the ERP   and sends it to the client,Relevant
If the client accepts the offer  the project manager receives the order form,Relevant
The order form is registered in the ERP system and a confirmation is sent to the client,Relevant
The contract is reviewed by the project manager  the file is prepared  and information is sent for the registration to delivery process and the quotation registration process is ended,Relevant
This process happens repeatedly throughout the day to journalists,Relevant
Indeed  they have to write several articles for the next day s daily journal,Irrelevant
The main subject of an article usually comes from an informant with a scoop   last minute information or from requests for coverage or news they received  for example through the  alert us  button of their website ,Irrelevant
Daily news and important events have priority over more common subjects,Irrelevant
Therefore  if crucial information is given by someone with a high position or an informant to a journalist  he must not hesitate to dive in and collect more information about it,Irrelevant
Once the subject is received or chosen  the first step is confirming the information with a reliable person,Relevant
We will consider Liège s Christmas market cancellation as an example,Irrelevant
The journalist obtaining this information then has to ask Liège s mayor to confirm it,Relevant
However  if the information comes from the  alert us  button  the journalist will set up a meeting with the person in order to further analyze it,Relevant
A subject with incoherent or false information will be rejected  whereas the process will continue for a reliable and true subject,Relevant
If a journalist were to obtain crucial information  it must be published  even partially  as soon as possible so that it is not stolen from the competition,Relevant
Thus  it is directly posted on Sudpresse s paying website,Relevant
On the contrary  if the information can wait  the journalist should collect more details about it,Relevant
Once it is done  the journalist makes a synthesis of the information he has received to this point  to know what he should search next,Relevant
In both cases  phone calls  emails and internet researches will follow in order to complete and detail the current subject,Relevant
The information research process ends as soon as the journalist has gathered enough detailed information to write the article,Relevant
The journalist is responsible for this process from its start to its end,Irrelevant
Sometimes  as demonstrated in the previous process  information must be revealed without delay to readers with a subscription,Irrelevant
That is why the information  written as quickly as possible  will be briefly explained on Sudpresse s paying website,Irrelevant
Following this event  a strategic marketing employee in the  newsroom  creates a teasing placed on the free website,Relevant
This teasing includes a link to the company s paying website,Irrelevant
Afterwards  the journalist will progressively continue filling out the online article on the paying website  adding information and upgrading the layout  until it is complete and perfect,Relevant
The journalist contacts his sources to find new he can add to his article,Relevant
If he gets new information from a tier  he contacts this tier  that becomes thus one of a source  or any other source who can verify clarify this new information,Relevant
The last version of the online article will be published the next morning in the traditional newspaper,Relevant
Compared to a few years ago  journalists do not write complete articles that only come out the following day as they first have to post them online,Irrelevant
This applies to any level of importance of the information,Irrelevant
Then  once the article has been completed and is published on the different websites  and when  due to the tight timing  the article must be finished to be in the next day s newspaper  the journalist asks for a page of the next day s daily journal and starts copying the article s content,Relevant
Before every publication  digital or paper  the articles are corrected by a spelling software a first time and a second time by a professional reviewer whose job is to avoid mistakes in the spelling and to ensure an optimal layout for the article,Relevant
Once the page for the daily newspaper is finished  it is sent to the rotary press in Nivelles,Relevant
This concludes the article writing and publishing process,Relevant
As soon as the pages from the different upcoming newspapers are received  the printing process begins at the Nivelles printing,Relevant
First  relief plates are made for every single page of each newspaper,Relevant
Then  these plates are put four by four on the rotary press,Relevant
Once this step is operated  the rotary press is switched on,Relevant
Then  plates go in the four primary colors and the newspapers  pages are printed,Relevant
At this stage  a mechanical system allows to assemble pages with one another  fold and bind them to form the newspaper,Relevant
The newspapers are then automatically packaged and are ready to be shipped,Relevant
During the whole work of the machine  printing  assembling     the work of the employee is simply reduced to monitor the machine,Irrelevant
The supply process of daily newspapers is critical and is obviously relying on the nature of past processes,Irrelevant
Any delay can be toxic for the supply process and could cause terrible financial losses for Sudpresse and for booksellers themselves,Irrelevant
First  we will focus on individual newspaper delivery,Irrelevant
Newspapers must be ready for delivery at 01 00 a m    they are put into trucks and taken to the sorting office in Brussels,Relevant
They are then charged 30 minutes before the departure into night trains taking them to the cities where the different sorting centers are located,Relevant
Once the newspapers are in those centers  vans are used to deliver them to the local post offices,Relevant
The postmen then deliver the newspapers in individual mailboxes,Relevant
This must take place before 7 30am  as it is essential that a good part of workers have enough time to read their newspaper before going to work,Relevant
We will now focus on bookshops delivery,Irrelevant
Instead of going to the Sorting post office in Brussels  trucks go straight to regional private delivery centers,Relevant
Newspapers are then sorted and dispatched in vans that deliver over four thousand bookshops all over Belgium,Relevant
This type of delivery should take place even earlier than the individual deliveries  7am at the latest  as bookshops make half of their daily sales before 9 am,Irrelevant
Through this process description  we realize that timing is essential in the press sector,Irrelevant
Nowadays  writing and creating new articles does not suffice to create enough value for multimedia companies,Irrelevant
Therefore  various advertising processes are in constant change in the press industry and are therefore impossible to describe entirely,Irrelevant
Nevertheless  thanks to the two interviews we have conducted with our contacts at Sudpresse  we were able to identify some crucial steps in these processes,Irrelevant
We established earlier that there is a market department running many analyses in order to determine what are the best advertising spots on the website  which format  which size  which colors  which position on the page  etc,Relevant
The IT department will then determine who sees what advert and most importantly  these people s background and profile by using big data,Relevant
Once the advertising spots have been defined  it is time for the sales department to intervene,Relevant
Using the data previously collected  sales teams have to sell these spots to advertisers,Relevant
Advertisers have many options,Irrelevant
On the newspaper  they can choose to advertise on a quarter of a page  half a page or an entire page  knowing that each of these options has a different cost and impact on the reader,Relevant
Different spots can be chosen on the website,Irrelevant
One option of advertising on the website is through storytelling  which has been a growing tendency in the previous years,Relevant
In this case  advertising is made through an interview of a representative of the concerned company  ending with a link to the company s website,Relevant
The interview is in this case realized after the writing of the contract,Relevant
An advertisement may appear one or multiple times  depending on the agreement that has been made between the sales teams and the advertiser,Relevant
Once the advertiser has decided what he wishes to do  a contract is written by the sales department of Sudpresse,Relevant
When it is done  the contract is sent to the advertiser,Relevant
The contract is often approved by the advertisers,Relevant
If it is not  the contract is reviewed,Relevant
A contract is never abandoned because if a contract has been written  it is because there is a demand from an advertiser,Irrelevant
The advert is then created and published in the chosen canals with a determined frequency and time frame,Relevant
The catering process starts when a customer calls a Poivre Sel point of sale for its services,Relevant
One of the employees answers the phone call and asks automatically for the date and the number and variety of products wanted,Relevant
The employee then asks for the customer s usual point of sale,Relevant
If the client doesn t call his her usual point of sale  the employee has to conduct the customer to the usual one and the order is sent there,Relevant
If the client is a new or a usual one  10 the employee then asks for the address,Relevant
Afterwards  he checks the availability of the employees on this date and this address,Relevant
If none of the employees is available  the process ends,Relevant
Otherwise  the employee answering the call determines the type category of the client and as a result of this proposes a series of products specific to the client,Relevant
It is then the job of the franchisor  CEO  to emit the invoice to the client,Relevant
He receives the payment and checks if there is any missing information,Relevant
If information is missing  he sends a formal notice to the customer with the ERP system of Poivre Sel  Teamleader ,Relevant
The franchisor receives the missing information and if it is still missing the purchase order is rejected,Relevant
When the payment is completed  the employees can start the order,Relevant
They deliver the order at the social event and the purchase order is completed,Relevant
The franchising process is quite simple,Irrelevant
Anyone interested in becoming a franchisee can obtain information at a point of sale or and on the website,Relevant
He then contacts Mr  Buche to ask him if he can become a franchisee,Relevant
Then Mr  Buche will meet with the interested party to explain the principle of his company and its history,Relevant
After this discussion  he asks the franchisee if he is still interested,Relevant
The franchisee will then give an answer to the franchisor,Relevant
If he decides to continue  then Mr  Buche will take him on a day long immersion trip to his point of sale in order to learn more about the franchisee and to show him how a day in a point of sale goes,Relevant
After that day  both parties take a week to think about whether or not they want to continue,Relevant
The decision comes from both parties,Relevant
If they continue  the prospective franchisee must sign a confidentiality document,Relevant
Once this is done  the franchisee starts looking for a location for their new outlet,Relevant
Once he has found it  he will show it to Mr  Buche so that he can take care of the market research and a cost benefit calculation to see if the location is ideal and profitable,Relevant
If it is not  the franchisee has to look for another location,Relevant
If it is  the calculations are sent to the franchisee s accountant for validation,Relevant
Once validated  it takes a few months for the fieldworks to be completed and then the franchisee pays Mr  Buche for the fieldworks,Relevant
The franchisee can then finally open his point of sale,Relevant
The franchisee receives the calendar of meetings for the year,Irrelevant
One of the franchisees has a new recipe idea,Relevant
He waits for the next meeting to propose it,Relevant
Then  we see if the idea is appreciated  if not  we stop,Relevant
If it is appreciated  the franchisee  who had the idea  suggests to make a vote,Relevant
The vote is made with all the franchisees and the franchisor by raising their hand,Relevant
If the majority raises their hands  we make the recipe  if not the requested is rejected,Relevant
A customer arrives in front of the cashier at Poivre Sel to eat,Relevant
First of all  the cashier asks him whether he is eating on the spot or to take away,Relevant
If the customer eats on the spot  the waiter makes him sit down and asks the customer what he wants to eat,Relevant
Once the order is taken  the waiter gives the order to the cook who prepares it and gives it back to the waiter once it is ready,Relevant
The waiter then takes the dish back and serves it to the customer,Relevant
Then the waiter waits until the customer s meal is over  i e  when the customer calls the waiter,Relevant
The waiter will then send him the invoice and receive payment from the customer and then hand over the money received at the cash desk,Relevant
If the customer has taken out  the cashier asks the customer for the order,Relevant
Then gives the order to the cook who prepares it and returns it to the cashier once the preparation is finished,Relevant
Then the cashier issues the invoice to the customer who pays it and the cashier gives him his meal,Relevant
If a product is missing from Poivre Sel he rings their supplier to see if the product is available  the office  manager  checks the database to see if the product is still in stock,Relevant
If the product is available  we ask for the quantity of this product  x  at Poivre Sel which will determine the quantity and then notify the supplier who will be able to prepare an invoice and send it  once the invoice is received and paid the stock manager will supply the product at Poivre Sel,Relevant
If the product is no longer available  the supplier asks for salt and pepper  if he wants to order  if the answer is no it is the end of the process if it is yes the supplier sends all the information  invoice delivery date  by e mail,Relevant
The process starts with the arrival of the worker at Emerson,Relevant
A renewal contract is when the end of his last contract is greater than 12 months,Irrelevant
He goes to the line manager who welcomes him  then he signs the contract and receives the badge,Relevant
Later  the line manager accompanies him to the social store,Relevant
He begins his training and medical supervision  and the process is over for him,Relevant
If the duration of his contract is less than 12 months  it is considered as a first contract,Relevant
Therefore  the worker is registered at the guard post  then he is greeted by the head of the department  who signs the contract and accompanies him to the social store and shows the worker the factory,Relevant
Later  the HR Business Partner transmits the Welcome Pack to the worker  then the training coordinator receives singled documents and classifies documents in personal files,Relevant
If an IT account must be created  the training coordinators must first present and then send the signature of the IT policy,Relevant
If not  the worker can receive induction training and medical supervision directly,Relevant
The process starts with the expiration of the contract,Relevant
Then  an exit interview takes place with the temporary worker and the coordinator  his release date is encoded on HR Access  the human resources management software package,Relevant
The C4  the unemployment certificate  and the certificate of employment is sent and issued to the worker by the coordinator then who then archives the paper file,Relevant
After that  the worker returns first clothes and keys at the social store and then the badge after the last score,Relevant
Finally the HR Payroll Specialist triggers the bonus at the end of year in HR access  applies the legislation on payment of the days after discharge  clears RHT and RTT hours and the process is ended,Relevant
The process starts with the payment of a deposit,Relevant
Then the HP Payroll Specialist emails to horses  managers before 10 a m  to conclude it,Relevant
Later  he carries out a different point of the checklist and encodes down payment work on the HR Access software,Relevant
He then downloads the payment batch on the bank s website and requests the lot signature to the Finance Manager who signs it,Relevant
Finally  the HP Payroll Specialist checks the sent lot and the worker receives the salary,Relevant
The process begins with the requirement of the Emerson Company,Relevant
The plant HR director invites the hierarchical manager to establish the schedule of objective meetings who will then carry out the evaluation with his employee via the HR Access pre software and will then transmit to the plant HR director,Relevant
if the manager has received the evaluations  he must review them  otherwise the plant HR director will invite the hierarchical manager again to review the evaluations and continue the process,Relevant
If the assessment is understandable  the plant HR director if we need training  if so  we set up training  and we evolve the performance of the end of the year and the performance assessment is completed,Relevant
If the evaluation sent is incomprehensible  the plant HR director discusses with the hierarchical manager who will complete and inform the collaborator who will send the document back to the plant HR director for review evaluation and the process continues normally,Relevant
The process starts when a position becomes available,Relevant
The HR Business Partner drafts the internal announcement and the HR Director validates the content of the announcement via the HR Access pre software  then sends it to the HR Business Partner for the dissemination of the internal announcement,Relevant
The HR Business Partner determines the evaluation criteria and then receives the applications by email,Relevant
The HR Business Partner conducts interviews and tests and evaluates them afterwards,Relevant
If the candidates respond to the applications of the function  they are informed by email and their personal data is deleted with the HR access pre software and finally they are ready to be hired,Relevant
If the candidates do not respond to the applications of the function  they consult the reserve of spontaneous applications,Relevant
The first business process is inbound logistics,Irrelevant
An employee takes care of placing the order with the suppliers,Relevant
All the raw materials needed to manufacture the finished products are stored in a large refrigerated hall within the company,Relevant
There is also a storage room that serves as a freezer because some materials arrive frozen,Irrelevant
The process of outbound logistics is quite similar to that of inbound logistics,Irrelevant
First of all  the company receives requests for the delivery of goods from outside  supermarkets  small shops    ,Relevant
Then  Goumanisto checks its stocks to see if it has the quantities requested by the buyers,Relevant
If it does not have them  it will send a note to inform the purchasing company of the impossibility of supplying the quantities requested,Relevant
The purchasing company can also decide to maintain the order  in which case Goumanisto will produce the missing products,Relevant
Once the products are available  the company will make up pallets that will be sent to the various stores via a delivery company,Relevant
As far as the recruitment process is concerned  it starts when a person shows interest in working for the company,Relevant
For operators  Goumanisto either uses a temporary employment agency to provide the necessary manpower or receives unsolicited applications  most of which are based on the knowledge of existing workers,Relevant
Each recruitment procedure consists of a minimum of 2  sometimes 3  interviews with the applicant,Relevant
The first one is with the direct manager  i e  the operations manager if the company is looking to hire an operator,Relevant
The second interview takes place in the presence of the company s managers,Relevant
Following this second interview  they decide whether or not the person is suitable,Relevant
Production is a very important business process at Goumanisto,Irrelevant
About 50 people are employed in production  and almost half of them come from the sheltered workshop,Irrelevant
The first room is made up of a recently acquired machine  it allows the various products to be cut very quickly and precisely,Relevant
Four to five workers are needed for this machine to work properly,Relevant
Then there is another machine that weighs the cut products and divides them into different batches according to the quantities required,Relevant
The next step is the reception of the products and their packaging,Relevant
This step is done by production line,Relevant
Currently there is a manual line with 10 people and an automated line with 5 people,Relevant
The automatic line checks that the machines properly close the boxes with plastic paper  then the manual line closes the boxes with plastic lids,Relevant
Goumanisto s objective is to acquire a new automated line by February 2021,Irrelevant
Finally  the various plastic boxes have to be closed and packed in cardboard boxes  both operations are still done manually,Relevant
This one could be a good candidate for automation,Irrelevant
Indeed  the labelling and the placing of the products packed in the cardboard boxes are still done manually so it would represent a saving of time if the company were to automate this process,Irrelevant
R D is also an important process for the organization,Irrelevant
Members are looking for new product ideas that may appeal to consumers,Irrelevant
Most often the company uses market research done by the wholesale distribution to whom it sells its products instead of doing its own surveys,Relevant
Then  they analyze the results of market research in order to embark on the development of new ideas of products,Relevant
The point of product ideas is obviously that these products can be sold in large quantities and at a lower price,Irrelevant
Then they compute the potential costs of producing these new product ideas,Relevant
If these can be profitable and lead to profit subsequently  they are validated by the R D department and presented to the general council,Relevant
On the other hand  if they could not be profitable  everything falls apart and the process stops,Relevant
It will therefore be necessary to start all over from the development of new product ideas,Relevant
The process starts when a client wants to employ temporary workers,Relevant
The client sends an email with a job description to the agency,Relevant
An Asap consultant analyzes the job description,Relevant
Then  he checks if there is an existing profile in the agency s database,Relevant
If a matching profile has been found  the process to employ a candidate begins,Relevant
If the candidate has been employed  the process ends,Relevant
If he has not been employed  the consultant will recheck in the database in order to search for another potential profile,Relevant
If one is found  the loop is going again,Relevant
If not an announcement is published on the agency site,Relevant
Moreover the consultant has to check the specificity of the job,Relevant
Indeed  when the client wants a very specific candidate  the agency has to actively research a candidate in addition to the published announcement,Relevant
When the job does not require any specific skills  the consultant only needs to wait for candidates to propose themselves,Relevant
Whether it would be a specific or a non specific job  when a candidate respondsto the announcement  the to employ a candidate process can start,Relevant
If the candidate has been employed  the process ends,Relevant
If the candidate has not been employed  the consultant researches or waits again for a candidate to answer the announcement,Relevant
However  if the agency can not find a candidate fast enough  the client must send a message to the agency to ask them to stop the process,Relevant
Indeed  the client works with several agencies so if another agency finds a candidate before Asap  the client has to warn Asap,Relevant
So  when Asap receives a message from the client  the agency must stop his searching process,Relevant
The process starts when a profile of interim which matches with the announcement has been found,Relevant
The first step is to call the candidate for a phone screening,Relevant
After the phone call  the candidate and the consultant agree for a date for a meeting,Relevant
Another option is that the consultant realized during the phonescreening that the candidate was not suitable for the job,Relevant
If so  the process ends,Relevant
If a meeting has been agreed  the consultant sends an email to the candidate with a confirmed date and some information over the meeting,Relevant
On the convenued day  the candidate goes to the meeting and the consultant rules the meeting,Relevant
The meeting starts when the candidate arrives,Relevant
So  the consultant can start the meeting,Irrelevant
Before discussing specific topics of the job  he has to check the candidate references,Relevant
After the discussion  the candidate has to pass a cognitive test,Relevant
The meeting ends when he leaves,Relevant
After the meeting  the consultant sends a report over the meeting to the client,Relevant
Then they have to wait for the client to respond,Relevant
When the client sends a feedback of the report to the agency  there are two possibilities,Relevant
On one hand  if the feedback is bad  the client does not want the candidate so the agency must send him a rejection message,Relevant
In this case  the process ends,Relevant
On the other hand  if the feedback is good  the client wants the candidate so the agency must send him an approval message,Relevant
After sending the message  the consultant makes the contract that he sends for the candidate to confirm and sign the contract,Relevant
The candidate resends the signed contract to the agency which then sends the contract to the client,Relevant
In this case  the candidate is employed and the process ends,Relevant
When the social secretary of ASAP receives the hours worked by the candidate for the client  the process can start,Relevant
The first step is to inform the bank to pay the hours worked,Relevant
When the bank receives the message from ASAP  she has to pay the worked hours to the candidate s bank account,Relevant
The candidate is then informed that he has received the payment,Relevant
The candidate checks if the payment is correct,Relevant
If it is the case  the process is fulfilled,Relevant
If it is not  he must inform the agency about the payment error,Relevant
On the side of the agency  if she doesn t receive a message from the candidate  the process is fulfilled but  when a payment error message is received  the agency must check if the candidate has been paid too much or not enough paid,Relevant
When the candidate has not been paid enough  the bank has to pay the extra hours on the candidate bank account and the process is fulfilled,Relevant
If the candidate has been too much paid  the agency must request a refund from the candidate,Relevant
So  the candidate pays the hours not worked to the bank and the process ends,Relevant
 We can imagine that the candidates would not send an error message if he has been paid too much,Irrelevant
However some of them do and ASAP counts on their honesty ,Irrelevant
The process starts when an employee evaluation is needed,Relevant
The superior calls the employee,Relevant
They plan a meeting together,Relevant
After the phone call  the superior sends an email with the confirmed date of the meeting,Relevant
On the said date  the employee goes to the meeting,Relevant
So  the superior can start the meeting,Relevant
He first checks if the KPIs of the employee are good,Relevant
Then  he discusses with him about his general feeling in the company,Relevant
After that  the superior can end the meeting,Relevant
When the meeting is finished and the employee is left  the superior makes a feedback that he sends to his employee,Relevant
From there  there are three possibilities,Relevant
Either the feedback is good so nothing happens or it is the first bad feedback so the superior warns his employee or it is the second bad feedback so the superior sends a breach of contract to his employee,Relevant
After each possibility  the process ends,Relevant
 We can surely say that the breach of the contract can be negotiated depending on the circumstances ,Irrelevant
When the agency has given a service to one of his clients  a consultant makes an invoice,Relevant
The business manager then checks the invoice,Relevant
 The invoice may not be correct if the client has had a credit note on a past delivery ,Irrelevant
If the invoice is not correct  the business manager resends the invoice to the consultant and he has to make the invoice again,Relevant
If the invoice is correct  the consultant can send the invoice to the client,Relevant
When the invoice has been sent  the consultant waits for the payment,Relevant
If the payment arrives within 5 days  the process is fulfilled,Relevant
If it is not the case  the consultant calls the client with a first warning,Relevant
After this call  if the payment has been completed within 5 days  the process ends,Relevant
If not  the account manager calls the client for a second warning,Relevant
The client has to pay within 5 days to finish the process if not the account manager sends an email about a potential bailiff venue and informs the bailiff about his potential venue,Relevant
To finish the process  there are two possibilities,Relevant
Either the client pays his debt within 50 days and the process ends or the account manager contacts the bailiff and the process is finished,Relevant
 the delays are so short because ASAP has to pay the temporary workers one week after the last day of the mission As mentioned above ,Irrelevant
The process starts with the interest of the client in finding a solution to the digital transformation his company needs  the first task is to propose and describe the 3 Bizz Online packs  get a response from the client  charge him and inform DJM,Relevant
The first contact always starts within Proximus stores  but the salesman only acts as an intermediate and only during the selling phase  after fulfilling the order he steps out of the conversation and an employee of DJM takes this over  firstly the manager,Relevant
The process starts when a customer enters a Proximus shop  either the customer goes to a Proximus shop because he is a freelancer interested in the Bizz online packs  or the seller proposes the Bizz online packs to him,Relevant
If the customer refuses the offer  the process is over,Relevant
On the other hand  if the customer is interested in the pack  the seller offers him the choice between 3 packs  S M L,Relevant
These packs are categorized according to their size  options and functionality,Irrelevant
They go from the most basic to the most specific,Irrelevant
Once the customer has made his choice  the seller informs a DJM manager of the customer s new request via an ERP system set up between the 2 companies  DJM and Proximus,Relevant
Bizz online employees then start a discussion with the customer in order to prepare the website as well as possible,Relevant
When the website is prepared  it is sent to the customer  who can then request the latest changes if he wants before the website is published,Relevant
If the client is satisfied with the website  it is published on the internet and the process is completed,Relevant
If the customer does not respond to the message sent within 5 days  a reminder message is sent,Relevant
This process starts when the client  who has already chosen either the M  pack or the L pack  is interested in receiving an e shop as an option in his pack,Relevant
After invoicing in a Proximus shop  the request of the client goes to a project manager of Bizz online who gets in touch with the client so that they can discuss the project,Relevant
Then  it s the webmaster who produces the e shop taking into account the suggestions of the client and does the modifications if necessary,Relevant
This process ends when the e shop is published,Relevant
The process starts when the manager receives a complaint,Relevant
He then registers it and transfers it to the webmaster,Relevant
The webmaster analyses the complaint and if more information is needed  he recontacts the client to receive the missing pieces of information,Relevant
If he can resolve it directly  he skips those steps and resolves it,Relevant
Then the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when a jobseeker sends his or her application to DJM by e mail,Relevant
The project manager receives the application and checks whether it contains the CV and covering letter  whether it contains the basic data such as name and surname  and whether the applicant has the required diploma to work at DJM,Relevant
If the documents are incomplete  the project manager will inform the applicant,Relevant
If the documents are complete  the project manager will contact the applicant through one of the channels provided on the CV to find a time to place an interview,Relevant
After the interview  if the candidate is hired  the project manager will send a rejection email,Relevant
After the interview  if the candidate is hired  an email is also sent to inform him her of the news,Relevant
The project manager then begins to enter the information collected from the application,Relevant
If he she notices that he she is missing data  he she contacts the candidate again to complete the application with the missing data,Relevant
Then he creates the contract  which he then sends,Relevant
The process starts when an employee is needed,Relevant
Then  the first task is made by the Head of department  who has to give specific criteria of the job  requirements  skills needed  ,Relevant
Once the task is completed  the HR employee has to see if it is a specific more special demand  or not,Relevant
Usually for nurses  they will look at spontaneous applications on the hospital website,Relevant
For more specific functions  they will externalize the process and recruit via Forum,Relevant
For more special requests  for example  energy engineer   they make an offer on the website themselves,Relevant
After having collected the CV  the HR employee has to to make a selection based on the head of department s criteria,Relevant
If there are a lot of applications  he can decide to filter the candidates by doing a written exam in order to screen people,Relevant
Due to the written exam  he has to select candidate and review application,Relevant
Once the task is completed  he has to decide if he approve or not the candidate,Relevant
If he didn t approve it  a rejection email will be sent to the applicant and the process is finished,Relevant
In the other case  the HR employee will have to schedule an online interview,Relevant
The head of the department has to conduct the personal interview and based on that  he will decide if he hire or not the candidate,Relevant
If he doesn t want to hire him or her a rejection email is sent to the candidate and the process is finished,Relevant
In the other case  the head of department has to inform the HR employee that the applicant is hired,Relevant
Finally  the HR employee has to create an administrative file with the applicant s information and create the employment contract,Relevant
Once the tasks are completed the process is finished    applicant employed ,Relevant
The process takes place in emergencies,Irrelevant
It starts when a patient arrives at the emergency room,Relevant
The emergency service has to register the patient and take his or her vital parameters as blood  pressure and so on,Relevant
These data are entered in the DPI system by the emergency service  which allows the doctor  even if he is not on site to consult that information,Relevant
The doctor specialist has to check the patient s data,Relevant
based on that  he has to evaluate the urgency,Relevant
If he considers that it is not urgent  he has to give instructions to the emergency doctor,Relevant
Then the emergency doctor has to treat the patient  schedule an appointment and discharge him or her,Relevant
Once the tasks are completed  the process is finished,Relevant
In the other case  which means that the doctor specialist considers that it is an urgency  he has to inform the nurses and check bed availability at the same time,Relevant
Nurses will then register the person in their department,Relevant
They absolutely have to have the approval of the medical specialist before they admit someone,Relevant
They cannot register a patient without that,Irrelevant
Finally  the nurses have to move the patient from the emergency room to the room service,Relevant
The process starts when medications are needed,Relevant
The first task is made by the nurse who has to check their department s drug needs for each patient,Relevant
The nurse then group everything together and send the order by fax  usually to the pharmacy,Relevant
In all hospitals  there is a pharmacy  so orders are sent there and directly processed,Relevant
The pharmacy checks if they have everything  usually they have everything ,Relevant
If some medications are missing  they have to inform the nurse of the product s non availability,Relevant
Then  they have to check the availability of the medications in another service  and send someone to take them,Relevant
Once they have received the medications  they have to notify the nurse  prepare all the medications and finally deliver them to the nurse,Relevant
The last task is made by the nurse  who has to prepare the medications for each patient,Relevant
Once the task is done  the process is finished    medications prepared ,Relevant
There are several possible cases ,Irrelevant
  In case of end of contract At the end of the contract  replacement contract  fixed term contract  there is nothing is simply over for the employee,Relevant
  In case of dismissal Dismissal can be caused by many things  usual causes ,Relevant
If the dis missal is sufficiently justified  HR will take care of giving notice,Relevant
  In the event of a decision to discontinue  e,Relevant
redirection to another hospital  It is up to the employee to request advance notice,Relevant
HR will ensure that the notice period is acceptable,Relevant
This process especially concerns the Meuse Tube Clinic in Flémalle  this clinic belongs to the CHBA group,Irrelevant
However  the process cannot be the same as in Seraing,Irrelevant
When a patient wishes to make an appointment  he can do so through three different channels  this can be done by phone  by mail  or on the spot at the counter,Relevant
In all three cases  the patient will come across the reception desk of the clinic,Relevant
However  if it is done by e mail  it may take longer to get an answer,Irrelevant
The receptionist will look at the places available and suggest an appointment date to the patient  then  an appointment will be scheduled,Relevant
The person at the reception desk will then check his or her contact details via his or her identity card and health insurance,Relevant
The patient has to pay directly on the spot  he will eventually receive an invoice,Relevant
After waiting in the waiting room  the doctor sees the patient,Relevant
He will check the  patient s medical history  in the CPR  computerized patient record   examine the patient and give recommendations for treatment,Relevant
Eventually  the doctor may request additional tests if the situation requires it or even transfer the patient to the emergency room in case of an emergency,Relevant
He can also schedule a hospitalization if he wants to follow the patient in real time,Relevant
The invoicing service will take care of the invoice which will depend on the technical services performed during the consultation  the status of the person and his or her health insurance company,Relevant
The maintenance and repair process uses one main software   Carpark,Irrelevant
Indeed  Carpark allows the management of all the vehicles from all the parks thanks to its database that includes all the information necessary about the vehicles from all the subsidiaries   the number plate  the intern references  but also the location of the maintenance  the maintenance plan that suits the vehicle the most according to the recommendation of the suppliers    Moreover  drivers also use Carpark in order to encode the kilometers travelled with the busses  which allows the automated planning of the maintenance every 15 000 or 30 000 kilometers  depending on the bus,Relevant
Those planned maintenances are sorted 1 500 kilometers in advance by the software in order for the technical and maintenance head to be able to plan their actual execution with the mechanics,Relevant
Of course  more completion dates can be added manually in accordance with a specific date of a specific number of kilometers travelled,Relevant
Lastly  Carpark keeps the history of all the maintenances and repairs that have been done on each vehicle,Relevant
The repair process starts with the transmission of a complaint through Carpark,Relevant
With this complaint  a driver signals a damage  a breakdown or an accident  after having made a research with the number of the vehicle in order to verify that the damage has not already been signaled and avoid any duplication,Relevant
The content of the complaint is the following   the problem  the vehicle concerned  its kilometers travelled  and  if the driver wants to  his email address or his phone number in order to receive a message when the complaint is taken in charge,Irrelevant
The technical and maintenance head can consult the list of all the complaints in Carpark,Irrelevant
He then decides of the moment the complaint has to be treated   depending on the urgency of the problem,Relevant
If the problem is considered as urgent  the technical and maintenance head directly visits the garage where the repair is going to be done in order to find mechanics who are available to take the bus in charge,Relevant
Otherwise  the repair is planned for a later day and will be taken in charge during the daily morning meeting between the technical and maintenance head and the mechanics where the work of the day is divided up,Relevant
The technical and maintenance head creates the workshop sheet related to each repair,Relevant
This sheet includes a description of the problem as well as the work that has to be done by the mechanics  and is identified by a specific codebare,Irrelevant
If the driver who transmitted the complaint gave a phone number or an email address  a message is automatically sent to him when the workshop sheet is created in order to let him know that the complaint is taken into account and that the bus is sent to the garage for repairs,Relevant
Following the daily planning of the mechanics  the technical and maintenance head sends the workshop sheets to the ones concerned by the repair,Relevant
With the use of a clocking software   each mechanic scans the barcode of the workshop sheet to indicate when he takes it in charge  and then when he is done with the execution of its content,Relevant
That enables the technical and maintenance head to know which repairs are ongoing and which ones are finished  but also to know the workforce that has been required for each of them,Irrelevant
Moreover  the mechanic indicates in the workshop sheet every piece that he used for the repair by scanning the barcode of them  which also allows an easy following of the evolution of the stock ,Relevant
Once the mechanic has finished the repairs  the completed workshop sheet is sent back to the technical and maintenance head who closes it,Relevant
That finally permits the creation of the invoice as well as the suppression of the complaint in the list in Carpark,Relevant
Of course  in order to make repairs on busses  it is essential to have efficient stock maintenance of the pieces required for those repairs,Irrelevant
It is the role of the technical and maintenance head to create the purchase orders  communicate them to the suppliers  take the delivery  control and approve the invoices,Relevant
Once a new piece arrives  either it is immediately used because it has been ordered for a specific repair that is ongoing or urgent  or the piece enters the stock,Relevant
Each piece of the stock is identified by a particular barcode  which is also useful to keep track of the pieces used during each repair  as mentioned previously   and has a particular place in the warehouse determined by a departement  a shelf and a level,Relevant
Keolis Belgium and its subsidiaries owns many gas stations with their fuel pumps  but they also manage the tankage of other stations in areas where they don t own any cistern,Irrelevant
This mix of their own tanks and the external tanks is centralized in one software  Telenaro   where the internal tanks are continuously updated  and the data from their external clients are imported two times a month,Relevant
Telenaro gathers all the societies  vehicles of the group  internal and external drivers  and data related   type of vehicle  maximum level of the fuel tank  baseline consumption  current consumption  and all the other details linked with the tankage,Relevant
That permits automated statistics about the consumption of fuel  as a way of efficient control despite the size of the entire group and the number of stations  vehicles and cisterns,Relevant
Moreover  the forecasting of the resupply of each cistern is based on an estimated range computed from the average daily consumption registered,Relevant
Lastly  Telenaro keeps the history of all the deliveries of fuel  the deltas given by the probes  see further   the alerts from problems during a delivery  etc,Relevant
Any anomaly in Telenaro can be corrected manually by an operator,Relevant
A new system of probes installed in some of the cisterns of the company gives an on live view of the fuel level,Relevant
In parallel to the probes  the level is also computed from the documented tanks and resupplies in Telenaro,Relevant
The delta between the probed level and the computed one allows the operators to identify any problems in the supply of fuel or in the tankage of some vehicles  i e  the amount of fuel delivered do not correspond to the one indicated on the invoice of the supplier   a driver tries to defraud by taking some fuel for its 7 own personal consumption   in winter  a quite big difference can come from the high consumption of the heaters for the scholar cars     ,Irrelevant
The probe of a cistern also detects if the amount of fuel varies whereas no delivery is ongoing because of a leak of fuel or a theft  which triggers an alarm,Relevant
It even gives the level of water in the cistern  due to the condensation in the cisterns  so that the operators know when they need to evacuate some of that water,Relevant
Most importantly  the probes replace the previously needed and costly physical presence of an operator in order to verify and control the proper conduct of each resupply,Relevant
The starting point of the resupply of a cistern is its low level of fuel,Irrelevant
To know if any tankage is required  the manager of a society can easily visualize the level of each cistern of its society thanks to Telenaro and its icons and colored level bars  see the adjacent illustration ,Irrelevant
In addition  the system automatically sends an alert to the manager when a particular level of fuel is reached whereas no tankage is planned yet,Relevant
When the operator decides that an order is needed   he calls for tenders  and the best price gets the order,Relevant
Then the manager makes the order to the supplier and sends an email to the subsidiaries in order to inform the local managers of the upcoming resupply,Relevant
All the ongoing orders are also registered in Telenaro,Relevant
When the delivery man arrives at the location of the delivery  the operator in charge at the station gives him the delivery probe that has to be scanned at the pump to allow the tankage as well as to confirm to Telenaro that the delivery is made,Relevant
After the tankage  the delivery man encodes the amount of fuel he just delivered  and the system will compare that amount to the one measured by the probe,Relevant
If they do not correspond  the system asks the delivery man to re encode the amount and makes the verification again,Relevant
After three times asking for re encodage  if the encoded amount and the probed amount still do not correspond  the system sends a message to the firm in order to signal it,Relevant
Then  the delivery is confirmed by the system to the operator in charge as well as to Telenaro,Relevant
The system automatically creates and sends the invoice to the society that benefited from the delivery  and a copy to the manager in charge so that he is able to control if the delivery corresponds to the negotiations made at the moment of the ordering,Relevant
It also generates the excise documents for the recovering as well as the official declaration for the Ministry,Relevant
When an operator from any department wants to make a purchase  he has to fill in an investment request,Relevant
Four different investment requests are used in Keolis Belgium for  ,Relevant
? Rolling stock  buses for regular lines  scholar lines  tourisms  but also trailers for the luggages   ,Relevant
? No rolling stock  supplies for the garages  tools  compressors   ,Relevant
? Properties  buildings  but also air conditioning  garage doors  led lights  bus wash   ,Relevant
? IT infrastructures  cabling  laptops  desktops  servers  magnetic access cards  surveillance cameras ,Relevant
See the annexes for samples of the four investment requests,Irrelevant
Once the investment request is completed  the amount of the expense is controlled by the purchase department regarding the budgetization of the year,Relevant
If the management validates the purchase  the investment request has now to be signed by the supervisor of the departments concerned by the purchase as well as a head of the purchase department in order to acknowledge the validation of the purely budgetary aspect,Relevant
Once the investment request has been signed  it is sent via email to the supplier that launches the delivery,Relevant
In order to close the process  the invoice still has to be validated by the purchase department that confirms the purchase,Relevant
The firm has a few master contracts with some suppliers  and all the subsidiaries are strongly encouraged to make their purchases through those master contracts as a priority,Irrelevant
Of course  case by case exceptions are possible but this tolerance toward the appeal to other suppliers is supervised   if a department constantly makes purchases with other suppliers that the ones concerned by the master contracts negotiated by the organisation  an operational manager or an head of the subsidiary will make sure it stops,Relevant
In fact  76% of the purchases of the organisation are made within master contracts,Irrelevant
For example  all the OPEX  Operational Expenditures  that concern office supplies are subject to master contracts,Irrelevant
If no master contract concerns the purpose of the purchase and if the amount if that purchase exceeds 5 000 euros  three offers generally have to be collected before making a choice of a supplier  in order to compare the price quality ratios  the delivery time  the quality of the after sales service  etc,Relevant
 here again  exceptions are of course possible ,Irrelevant
The final choice of a supplier is made by the purchase department in tandem with the ones who will benefit from the purchase,Relevant
Besides those master contracts  the company also has some price conventions and other pre negotiated purchase terms with some other suppliers,Irrelevant
Whenever the company wants to broaden the number of clients it reaches  the very first step concerns the work of the marketing team,Relevant
The aim is to get information about potential clients in order to determine if the company can propose valuable services to them and conclude an order,Irrelevant
This preparation is essential because it is the foundation of the sale process   the sales representatives from the commercial team have to be well prepared for the coming negotiation,Irrelevant
Once the information has been collected through market analysis  the commercial team contacts the potential client and a first negotiation takes place,Relevant
The aim is to determine whether the client is interested by the potential offer  and the sales representative bases its argumentation on the client analysis previously communicated by the marketing department,Relevant
After the negotiation and if the client is indeed interested  a first offer is created,Relevant
This offer needs to be signed by several managers   if the offer is not appropriated  it might compromise the sale,Relevant
After having been signed  the offer is sent to the client by email,Relevant
If the client directly accepts the offer  the sale is validated and the processes of invoicing and delivering can start,Relevant
But if the client is not entirely satisfied with the proposition  more negotiations can take place in order to have the approval of the client  while still respecting the frames and goals from the management,Relevant
Repeating the last circle several times would be very heavy due to the long approbation chain   but that almost never occurs   generally  if the second offer is still not validated by the client  the sale is cancelled,Relevant
Empty bottles are returned by the customers  once the bottles are received we sort the types of bottles before washing them afterwards  we control the cleanliness of the bottles and the quality of the bottles with a laser to detect the slightest defect,Relevant
If the bottles have defects  they are rejected and if not  they are kept,Relevant
Then the bottles are filled  captured  labelled and marked with the expiry date,Relevant
Then the bottles go to the warehouse for storage,Relevant
AB Inbev needs bottles so they will order the bottles from their suppliers,Relevant
The suppliers check the order if it is accepted  a confirmation is sent to AB Inbev  then the suppliers plan the transportation  then they send the invoice and at the same time the bottles are delivered by truck to AB Inbev,Relevant
Once the trucks are received  AB Inbev unload the trucks and then they check the goods  if everything is good  the bottles are stored  if not  AB Inbev sends the bad products back to the suppliers and the suppliers will send a new invoice and the good products or missing products to AB Inbev who will unload the trucks  check the goods before storing them,Relevant
purchase order is received at the logistics department  if it is a new customer  it has to be entered into the VPO System which is used by all AB Inbev breweries,Relevant
The VPO manager will then send the order information to the warehouse  which will then check the availability of the beer for the order,Relevant
If everything is available  the order is prepared  otherwise a request is sent to the packaging department to produce the missing beer,Relevant
Once the beer is ready  it is delivered and the invoice is sent to the customer,Relevant
AB InBev receives unsolicited applications but also via other channels  Indeed and Forem   the People department receives applications,Relevant
1  CV screening consists of the elimination of CVs that do not meet the criteria requested by the company  and when information is missing we send an e mail to warn the candidate,Relevant
If they do not meet the criteria  their application will not have been selected,Relevant
2  The telephone interview  the recruiter will contact the selected candidates by telephone  5 10 minutes ,Relevant
If he is convinced  he will invite the candidate to the recruitment morning,Relevant
3  The recruitment morning is a collective interview  there is a series of tests,Relevant
Successful candidates are contacted by telephone to invite them to the next interview with the N 1 or N 2,Relevant
4  Interview with the department manager   The manager turns his interview more towards the personality of the candidate,Relevant
If the candidate is accepted  he or she is invited to a training course,Relevant
5  Form Alim  training  Form Alim is a training course specially created for production operators in the food industry,Irrelevant
6  The first  seasonal  contract and coaching  When signing the contract  the candidate is invited to the People Department to complete documents,Relevant
7  The permanent contract  If the employee receives a sufficient number of positive feedbacks  his manager is satisfied with his work and ABI has the opportunity to do so  he will be offered a permanent contract,Relevant
Different types of malts are put together in the tank,Relevant
They are crushed in order to extract the fermentable sugar,Relevant
The resulting product is then mixed with heated water in a vat,Relevant
Then the liquid is pumped into another tank in which the husks of the grains are separated from the suicidal liquid,Relevant
The liquid obtained is then subjected to strong heat in a kettle,Relevant
After this step  we will be able to proceed to the fermentation process  we will add hops and yeast which will convert the sugar into beer  then we will cool the beer  filter it and add CO2 to make the beer sparkling,Relevant
So all that remains is to wait until the beer is mature  3 weeks  before it can be sold and consumed,Relevant
The aim of this process is to answer  positively or not  to an employee s holiday request,Irrelevant
The process starts when an employee makes a request which is received by a human resource analyst,Relevant
The analyst takes charge of the request by changing its state to « pending »  which means that the demand is neither approved nor rejected,Relevant
Then  the request is sent to the manager of the requester s department,Relevant
This is the first step that the request has to go through,Irrelevant
If the manager rejects the request  the analyst changes its state to « rejected » and the process ends with a notification sent to the employee,Relevant
Otherwise  if the manager accepts the request  the analyst changes the state of the request to « approved » and the first step is done,Relevant
After that  the request also has to be granted by the human resource manager,Relevant
The aim of this process is to allocate human resources to a specific task,Irrelevant
To understand it properly  it is common sense yet important to note a human resource cannot be assigned to a project if this one doesn t already exist,Irrelevant
In the same way  we cannot create a project before having a customer to which it relates,Irrelevant
So in the most common cases  the manager will want to allocate a human resource to a specific project  so he is going to trigger the process by its higher start event,Relevant
Then  he is going to create and fulfill the new resource page and add it on the project,Relevant
That leads straightly to the higher end event and this is the shortest way to go through the process,Relevant
Otherwise  if  after trying to create this page  the software realizes that this new resource doesn t refer to an existing project  the process leads the analyst to the creation of this one,Relevant
This is the role of the first gateway,Irrelevant
After successfully filling each step  the process brings back the analyst on the first line and to the first end event,Relevant
In the same way  if  during the creation of a new project  the software realizes that this project doesn t relate to a registered customer  then the process leads the analyst in the encoding of this new customer,Relevant
This is the role of the purple gateway,Irrelevant
After having registered this new customer  the process brings the employee back to the second and then to the first line that leads again to the first end event,Relevant
Of course we could imagine the case where the analyst would only want to create a new project or to register a new customer without immediately allocating a resource to it,Irrelevant
This is the role of the second and the third start events  which respectively leads to the second and third end events,Irrelevant
This business process is triggered when the training manager wants to create a training,Relevant
If the training has not already been taught in the past  then the manager has to create a whole new training,Relevant
 cfr linked subprocess ,Irrelevant
Otherwise  the manager only has to schedule the session of related training  called then a session  and contact the external trainer of his choice  specialized in this field,Relevant
As the attendance needs to be recorded for obvious financial and organizational reasons  the manager establishes a list of attendees thanks to the form sent earlier on and the IT training system,Relevant
1 week before the training s day  a reminder is sent by email to the attendees,Relevant
After the session  the manager has to perform 3 tasks simultaneously  ask for a debrief  apply the post training process and update attendees  skills in the database,Relevant
That being done  the whole process finally ends,Relevant
Subprocess   If a training has not been given yet on a particular subject in the past  the manager has to design the training and fill a form with the details of it,Relevant
If the HR director does not accept the training framework for various reasons  the training being too expensive  too time consuming for the human resources etc   the manager has to re evaluate it and redesign the training,Relevant
Otherwise  the manager can select the language the training will be given in  French  English or both ,Relevant
Finally  he has to save the choices made before and this creates the training in their IT training system,Relevant
This BPMN is relative to the internal invoicing and the payment of an internal contract,Irrelevant
It happens when an entity of the group ARHS offers its services to another entity,Relevant
The accounting officer of the entity providing its services receives the  framework  which is the name given to an internal contract from the indebted entity s accounting department,Relevant
The latter selects lines corresponding to the framework and records it in  Interco  which is the software used for internal contracts,Relevant
After that  the accounting officer clicks on the button  send to invoice  and the invoice is registered as  to be received  in  FICO  which is the general accountancy software,Relevant
Finally  the accounting officer waits for the payment and sends a reminder after 30 days of waiting to the indebted entity,Relevant
They do not charge any kind of late fees to each other as they are all part of the same group,Irrelevant
Once it is received  the invoice gets archived,Relevant
If the company finds an interesting profile  the HR employee searches for information about them  creates a proposal  and sends them an email,Relevant
If the person rejects the proposal or does not respond to it within three weeks  the process ends,Relevant
However  if they accept the proposal  the human resources employee calls them to set up a meeting a week later,Relevant
Once the interview has been made  the HR employee arranges a visit to the company for a moment later,Relevant
Once the visit and the interview have been carried out  a skills test for the potential future employee has to be taken,Relevant
Depending on their result  the company decides whether to hire them or not,Relevant
If the answer is yes  the company considers a contract proposal and calls the candidate to discuss it,Relevant
The company is then awaiting for their response,Relevant
The latter can accept or refuse the contract,Irrelevant
If the answer is negative  a new call is scheduled to renegotiate the employment clauses,Relevant
If accepted  the employee is hired and their profile is registered in the company system,Relevant
Another way to get into the hiring process is to apply through an online form on the company website or to spontaneously apply to the company,Relevant
In the first case  the documents of the applicants  their CV and the online form will be analyzed by a human resources employee,Relevant
In the second case  the employee will only analyze the documents and CVs of the applicants,Relevant
Based on these documents  the employee decides whether or not to go on with the process by calling the candidate if selected,Relevant
The process starts when a message from the MRP system2 is received,Relevant
Indeed  to manufacture a pump for a customer  they need material resources  and the MRP system knows it so it sends notifications to the central purchasing department that will then take care of this information,Relevant
Then  three activities have to be done in parallel  • Create an X Flow3 • Request for quotation to the supplier • Do a framework agreement price matrix  it is done to calculate costs of the pump ,Relevant
When these 3 tasks are completed  the company places an order with its supplier who then takes care of the delivery,Relevant
Then the product is sent to the quality control to check the quality of the products received,Relevant
If the quality does not meet the expectations  they are sent back to the supplier and the supplier delivers better products or does some repairs on them,Relevant
If the quality is good  they are sent to the Central purchasing department with the invoice,Relevant
When the invoice is received  they have to validate the invoice in order to confirm that everything is ok and matches the information in the X Flow  which allows the accounting department to free up money and the process ends like this,Relevant
The process starts when the planning department receives a sales order from the customer,Relevant
They are then able to prepare a preliminary planning and to give feedback to the project manager for the kick off meeting  KOM ,Relevant
Then  the master planner attends the KOM and  thanks to the minutes of meeting  MOM  that he receives by mail  he can update the planning and save a deadlines baseline that contains all the project s milestones,Relevant
The planning department can then launch the production order by putting it into the SAP system,Relevant
Then  meetings take place each week until the end of the production,Relevant
In case there are delays due to some modifications in the plan of the pump or delays due to late deliveries from the supplier  the project manager is informed and he gives this information to the planning department,Relevant
The planning is then updated,Relevant
The whole company is supposed to follow this planning and to act according to it,Irrelevant
The process ends when the pump is done,Relevant
The process starts when an idea of conception comes to the mind of somebody in the business unit,Relevant
Then the business unit makes a project proposal  and a detailed analysis is done,Relevant
Then the product development team does the technical specifications and after that the stakeholders make an analysis of the product and decide whether it is feasible or not,Relevant
If they say that it is infeasible  the process ends,Relevant
But if it is feasible  then the business unit  the product development team and the operations and procurement team meet during a kick off meeting to talk about the project,Relevant
Then  those three teams work together in order to make a deeper analysis and conceptual generic drawings,Relevant
Then  they still work together to set up a detailed drawing with technical specifications this time,Relevant
When those tasks are done  the product development team realises final manufacturing drawings with all the composing parts,Relevant
Then the three teams above mentioned have to gather all the data to put it in the manufacturing file,Relevant
After all these activities  the pump is ready to be sold so the product development team puts it in the product catalogue and the process ends,Relevant
The process starts when the production order is received from the SAP system,Relevant
The workers can then take the raw parts needed for a specific pump in the warehouse,Relevant
When it is done  they send a notification to inform the SAP system that this step of the production is done,Relevant
Then the system sends a work order to the workers in the machining service and two activities are done in parallel   the transformation of raw parts that is done by the workers and the one that is done by the subcontractor,Relevant
When all the pieces are transformed by the subcontractor or by the workers  they can store those finished materials in the warehouse and once again inform the SAP system,Relevant
Then they receive another work order from SAP to pre assemble the pump,Relevant
When it is done  they store the subsets and inform SAP,Relevant
Once again they receive a work order  and they have to do two activities in parallel   do the piping and assemble the bareshaft pump4,Relevant
Then when those two activities are done  they can assemble the final pump and check its performance thanks to an internal and an external quality controller,Relevant
If the performance is of good quality  the pump is dispatched,Relevant
A notification is then sent to SAP and the process ends,Relevant
If the performance is poor  they solve the problem and then they check again if it is ok,Relevant
The process starts when the customer notifies a problem to the after sales department,Relevant
They receive the defective material at the plant and they create a file,Relevant
Then  they are able to estimate a quote,Relevant
The next step is assessing the problem,Relevant
If the problem comes from the customer  the warranty will not be applied but if the company is responsible for it  the customer will have to pay nothing for the repairs,Relevant
In the case where the customer is under warranty  they apply it,Relevant
If he is not under warranty  a final quote is set up and the customer has to accept or to reject it,Relevant
If he rejects the quote  the file is closed and the material is sent back,Relevant
The company can still charge him for the time they spent on the pump  so they can also create an invoice before sending back the material,Relevant
In the case where he accepts the quote  or right after having applied the warranty  they create a work order  WO ,Relevant
Then they get the material they need to do the repairs thanks to the central purchasing,Relevant
Then they have to consider if those are small or big repairs,Relevant
If a big repair has to be done  they go on site to do it because of practical reasons  then they create the invoice and the process ends,Relevant
If it is only small repairs  they do it at Sulzer s workshop and then they send back the material,Relevant
Once it is done  they create the invoice and the process ends,Relevant
Before really getting into the recruitment process  it is important to know that Resultance tries its best to approach young people,Irrelevant
To do this Resultance is present in schools and on various recruitment sites to promote the company and attract young people,Irrelevant
The recruitment process takes place in several stages,Irrelevant
Applications are received by the HR managers  who then sort and select the best applications,Relevant
Once an application is selected  an interview is set up between the candidate and the HR managers,Relevant
Then the candidates selected after the first interview are interviewed by a partner of the firm,Relevant
Once the candidate has been selected  the integration phase begins  the candidate will receive a salary package from the HR department  and a mentor will be appointed to supervise the new candidate and help him or her integrate as well as possible,Relevant
A form is sent to all members of the firm to inform them of the arrival of a new employee,Relevant
The integration process  On the first day  the employee is welcomed by the HR department and the administrative assistant,Relevant
The employee is given his or her work tools  mobile phone  PC  car  and is explained the IT tools used at Resultance,Relevant
They are told what they need to know about the firm  the company s values are explained to them and they receive their assignment,Relevant
He will be attached to a project and will know the manager who is going to supervise it,Relevant
The welcome continues with the godfather or godmother over a meal to immediately create a relationship and ensure that the new employee is well integrated,Relevant
The employee is then monitored and supervised by his or her manager and feedback is given to ensure that he or she develops well,Relevant
A diagnosis is launched at the customer s premises  an employee will describe the company  its level of performance in the different departments,Relevant
Risks at the level of processes and organisation will be assessed,Relevant
The intensity of the changes will also be highlighted by the employees responsible for the diagnosis,Relevant
To do this Resultance uses the SWOT tool and focuses on the opportunities,Irrelevant
Once the diagnosis has been established  the employees will share the findings and recommendations resulting from the client s analysis,Relevant
From this moment on  improvement paths will be described and will reveal the quantitative and qualitative gains that can be made,Relevant
Then a member of staff will draw up a detailed action plan in the form of a gantt chart for each area of improvement,Relevant
Once the diagnosis has been made  the areas for improvement put forward  it is up to the management team to decide whether or not to take action,Relevant
The diagnosis will make it possible to define the duration of the mission and the number of employees required for the project,Relevant
Based on this  an estimate can be drawn up and presented to the client,Relevant
Based on the investigation and on a formal decision taken by the management team  a project is launched,Relevant
Resultance pursues the analysis of the client s company in order to gain credibility and establishes the collaborative relationship,Irrelevant
The employees responsible for the project build new tools  propose new working methods and processes,Relevant
Workshops are set up at the client s premises to directly involve stakeholders in the changes proposed by Resultance employees,Relevant
Each new proposal must be validated by the steering committee  responsible for ensuring that a project runs smoothly within a company ,Relevant
The tools are then deployed in the field,Relevant
In order to ensure that the methodologies are properly transformed into results  Resultance employees working at the client s site set up and lead the teams to ensure that the new tools are actually implemented,Relevant
The teams are monitored until they reach the objectives set by Resultance,Relevant
This ensures a real collaborative relationship between Resultance and the client,Irrelevant
To ensure that the project runs smoothly  a meeting is held once a week with the Resultance project manager and the client s internal project manager,Relevant
This makes it possible  for example  to resolve any problems immediately if there are any,Irrelevant
In addition to this  every 4 to 6 weeks  a steering committee  with the management committee of the client company  is set up to take stock of the actions carried out in the project  to take stock of progress and any problems encountered,Relevant
This monitoring makes it possible to give new directions to the project or change priorities,Irrelevant
And finally  Resultance ensures the proper transfer of knowledge and tools put in place to ensure sustainability,Relevant
The client is then autonomous and benefits from continuous improvement,Irrelevant
When a new employee joins the company  his or her objectives and expectations are entered into the database of a tool called  Workday ,Relevant
This tool centralizes and automates all the decisions related to human resources management such as managing holidays and leaves  evaluations  sending reminder for deadlines and registering automated approvals,Relevant
In addition  this process requires little or no supervision,Irrelevant
This process of human resources management ends when the employee leaves GSK,Relevant
Once a customer has placed an order  the documents related to the purchase are received at the factory while the documents related to transport and the products  badge with date of production and expiry date  are handled manually,Relevant
The warehouse verifies on paper that the data on the pallets is consistent with the order,Relevant
Then  the papers are scanned and sent to the quality team,Relevant
The quality team makes verifications before signing and archiving the file,Relevant
After that  the products related to the order can be released,Relevant
This process starts when a client requests a pricing offer to the local Belgian GSK team,Relevant
An employee receives the request and prepares a pricing offer,Relevant
Then  according to the 4 eyes principle  another employee from the Belgian team checks the offer,Relevant
If there is a discrepancy  the offer is corrected,Relevant
When the offer is finally approved  it is sent to the central team in India to copy it in SAP,Relevant
The central team signals that the offer is confirmed to the local Belgian team by email,Relevant
When this email is received in Belgium  the offer is confirmed to the client,Relevant
There are 3 possibilities for GSK to receive an order for their products from a customer ,Relevant
• The customer can place his order through a sales representative of GSK during a physical visit,Relevant
This case applies mainly to the pharmacies,Irrelevant
The representative encodes the order on a tablet connected to the GSK ordering system,Relevant
• The customer can also place orders by e mailing the company,Relevant
When the e mail is received  the customer service checks the availability of the products ordered,Relevant
The order is checked and sent to the warehouse if the items are in stock,Relevant
In case of shortage  the customer is of course notified,Relevant
• The third possibility consists in the customer using GSK s platform thanks to a personal identifier interfaced with EDI  Electronic Data Interchange ,Relevant
Once the order is confirmed  it is sent to the warehouse,Relevant
After receiving the order  the warehouse verifies that the information is correct,Relevant
Then  a staff member in the warehouse picks up the different articles with a cart,Relevant
Once the products are picked up  they are boxed and packed,Relevant
Then  the order is placed on pallets to be delivered to the customer,Relevant
The tracking of the order and the expected delivery time can be consulted at any time by the customer thanks to the label on the order,Irrelevant
When the products are received by the customer  the invoice is sent,Relevant
This process starts when a customer has a complaint about the price or the quantity of one order,Relevant
He or she has to contact the customer service,Relevant
Even if the contact is made by phone  an e mail has to be sent to have a written proof of the complaint,Relevant
Then  the customer service has to ask the sales manager if the correct price was applied the right quantity was sent,Relevant
If it is  the process ends with sending an email of rejection of complaint to the costumer,Relevant
If the price quantity is not correct  the customer service generates a credit note and send it to the sales manager who has to print sign scan before sending it back to the customer service,Relevant
Then the customer service also has to print sign scan send it and reimburse the customer,Relevant
The law obliges GSK to keep proof of the complaint for 7 years,Irrelevant
This storage is currently done through paper format documents,Irrelevant
There are two ways to find out something is missing,Irrelevant
Due to the digital transformation  most of the inventory is automatically done at the end of the day,Irrelevant
So  every morning  the supply manager  when he sees the ERP alert  purchases the products missing  or practically missing ,Relevant
The manager is constantly prospecting but if something is missing  he does not have the time to ask every supplier to make a quote  that is a support activity,Relevant
The other way to find out something is missing is by a warehouse worker,Relevant
Thanks to ERP  it is hardly happening,Irrelevant
But  if while he is picking products  something is missing or the quality is not good enough  he will directly alert the supply manager so he will purchase new ones,Relevant
Suppliers are listed in the  supplier database   where the manager can retrieve which product is from which supplier,Irrelevant
The invoice is finally sent to the financial department where it will be paid,Relevant
Most of the leads are firstly received by a telemarketer by mail or by a phone call,Relevant
They will take the information about the client and insert them into the  Customer database ,Relevant
We will assume that every lead is about B2B,Irrelevant
If the client does not need delivery or a quote  he should go to the  cash and carry  shop in Droixhe,Relevant
The telemarketer will then send the address of the delivery to receive a day of delivery for the client,Relevant
If for some reason  the day proposed by the transporter does not suit the client  the financial department will analyze if it could  economically  be possible to charter a truck just for him,Relevant
If not  the lead will be aborted,Relevant
If the client agrees and does not need a physical appointment  the telemarketer will make a quote,Relevant
Otherwise  he will attribute the client to a salesman available who will set an appointment and make the quote,Relevant
When the first quote is made  by the salesman or the telemarketer  the client might refuse it or accept it,Relevant
If the client accepts it  the contract will be signed  and the order made,Relevant
If not  he might not be interested anymore and the case would be closed  or he might want a better quote,Relevant
The salesman telemarketer will need approval from the financial department to lower prices or make a promotion,Relevant
If it is not possible to do a better quote  the case will be closed,Relevant
If it is  the salesman telemarketer will make the new quote which might  once again  be approved or refused by the client,Relevant
And so on  until the client declined the offer or consented to it,Relevant
When the order arrived at the warehouse  if there are some products that need to be pre commanded  the manager will do so  and the order will be handled as soon as delivered,Relevant
Otherwise  he will assign the order to an available worker,Relevant
He will receive the order on his scanner,Relevant
It indicates the emplacement of products and their quantity,Irrelevant
If the product needed is not there  the work must advise the manager so he can report the error  corrects the database  and purchases the product needed,Relevant
Every time the picker picks something  he must check the quality and the expiration date in order to avoid any return,Relevant
When all the products of the order are picked  the worker needs to check that the weight and the volume correspond to what is expected by the ERP,Relevant
Then  if everything is right  the worker will confirm the order and emit the shipment order,Relevant
If the order is canceled  the financial department will determine the cancelation penalty and charge it to the customer  and if the product was not shipped yet  the manager will handle the product return,Relevant
When the order is delivered  the transporter sends a delivery note to the financial department,Relevant
Then  every Monday  they emit the invoice for every customer delivered,Relevant
If after 14 days  they still do not have the payment  they will send a reminder,Relevant
If after another 14 days  the order is still unpaid  the debt recovery will start and the client will be stuck,Relevant
